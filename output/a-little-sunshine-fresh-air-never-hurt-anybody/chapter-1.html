		<h1>The First Day Of Summer Vacation</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p>Sweet Apple Acres, Ponyville</p><p>Summer vacation had just barely begun but Applejack found herself wide awake and alert. She peered over at the digital radio-clock sitting atop her dresser and confirmed that it was, in fact, only five thirty in the morning. Not one to find sleep easily again once she was roused from bed, Applejack decided to get her day started even though she had nothing better to do. Traditionally, Saturdays were reserved as a day of rest and recuperation for the Apple Family. Yet, the blonde-haired teen felt restless for some reason. It was hard to relax when you had your whole future ahead of you.</p><p>To put things into perspective, Applejack had just recently graduated from Ponyville High School the day prior. While she was happy to have earned her GED, it was also the first time in the eighteen-year old’s life where she had to choose what she wanted to do after summer ended, instead of just moving on to the next grade. To that end, Applejack had an inkling as to what career path she wanted to take but it was hardly set in stone. </p><p>Even so, most colleges in the area wouldn’t start classes until the first week of September. She still had a solid three months to think about enrollment and set her priorities straight. For now, however, she settled for a set of early morning stretches to get the blood pumping. Upon feeling the tension in her neck give way with a satisfying crackle-pop, Applejack padded over to the mirror, placed her hands on her hips, and gave her body a once over. </p><p>At just over one hundred and ninety centimeters, Applejack was considerably tall for someone (<i>realistically just about anyone</i>) her age. A fact which, combined with her farmhand physique, made a lot of people feel intimidated wherever she went. It didn’t help matters that she was outspoken and honest when she gave her opinion on any subject. This applied to just about every aspect of her social life. Including but not limited to: friendships, dating, and shindigs. </p><p>With a heavy sigh, Applejack ran her fingers over her abs. Most teenagers would kill to have a six pack like hers. But what most of them didn’t realize was how much of that came from plain old hard work on the farm. The same applied to her all-over tan. There wasn’t a single spec of skin on her body that wasn’t golden brown and dotted with clusters of freckles. It was the inevitable result of working out in the sun all day long in nothing but her birthday suit. </p><p>In fact, if Applejack could help it, she preferred to be nude no matter what she was doing (<i>save for her pa’s Stetson</i>). At least, that was the case while she was residing at Sweet Apple Acres. It was private property, after all. The Apple Family themselves had adopted the naturist way of life for countless generations, all the way up to the current one. It was both natural and expected of each family member to go about their daily business in the nude.</p><p>Some people found such a custom strange and inappropriate. Some even went so far as to call it perverse. Applejack herself, thought not such a thing. She’d been raised to appreciate the simple pleasures naturism had to offer and saw the human body as something to be celebrated, not shunned. In that regard, it made her a very well-adjusted young woman. She felt comfortable in her own skin and nothing would ever change that. Yet, it wasn’t always so easy to explain her way of life to other people without causing some of those unfortunate misunderstandings. After a few mishaps with some classmates in junior high, Applejack decided to keep her family’s naturist lifestyle from others a secret. She’d grown tired of all the pain and rejection.</p><p>Applejack turned around a few more times to inspect her breasts and buttocks. They were just as firm and shapely as ever. Hardly any jiggle to them at all. It made sense, considering how much muscle was packed underneath them. For a brief moment, she lamented that if her assets were softer, would they make her seem more feminine? More appealing to others? She dismissed the thought almost as quickly as it appeared in her brain. It was foolish to entertain such ideas. </p><p>Applejack scoffed. “Ain’t nothin’ wrong with mah body. Just a visual representation of all the hard work Ah put in every day pickin’ apple n’ haulin’ stuff around the acres. Eeyup. That’s it.”</p><p>The appeal of her less than feminine physique wasn’t the only thing Applejack questioned at times. Absentmindedly, she ran her fingers through the thick, silky blonde tuft of hair that lay nestled in-between her legs. Based solely on evidence presented by the vogue magazines she’d read (<i>borrowed from a classmate named Rarity</i>), Applejack came to the conclusion that a lot of young women liked to keep their lady parts barer than a baby’s behind, or at least trimmed down to a tiny strip. What a strange notion!</p><p>Once and only once did Applejack attempt such a drastic grooming technique. Most of the time, she was content to keep her pubic hair spruced up just enough to keep it from looking like a wild, tangled mess. Otherwise, she felt naked (<i>figuratively</i>) without something to accentuate her privates and give them an air of womanly mystique. Waxing all of it off just made her look like a little girl who hadn’t gone through puberty yet. That didn’t sit well with Applejack at all.  </p><p>In any case, Applejack was done contemplating such matters and set about taking a shower. After a quick lather of all-purpose shampoo and bodywash, the farmgirl toweled off. Not one to favor cosmetics, she chose not to wear any (<i>as usual</i>) and focused on brushing her long, blonde locks instead. Once she was satisfied that she looked presentable, she headed down the stairs and into the kitchen. With any luck, the rest of her family was already awake and starting breakfast. </p><p>Like clockwork, her older brother, Big Mac, was busy making pancakes. As oft was his inclination, the muscled farmer wore a bright green apron to prevent anything hot from spilling onto his family jewels. Otherwise, he was just as naked as his sister. Without uttering a word, he paused from cooking, and handed Applejack a cup of hot coffee. Milk with no sugar. Just the way she liked it. Upon taking a seat at the table, Applejack took a sip and sighed.</p><p>“Aren’t ya gonna make some smart-aleck remark ‘bout how I’m up so early on the first day of summer vacation?” </p><p>“Eenope. Ah know yer a creature of habit, AJ.” Big Mac intoned. </p><p>“Takes one ta know one.”</p><p>“Eeyup.” </p><p>Applejack put down her coffee and leaned back in the chair. “Ah know Ah should be relaxin’ but… there’s a lot goin’ on in mah mind. Thinkin’ ‘bout the future n’ such.”</p><p>Without saying a word, Big Mac turned off the stove and walked up behind his little sister. He could tell that she was stressed out about what she was going to do beyond high school. Getting up early on a Saturday wasn’t necessarily the dead giveaway, she’d done that a few times before. However, it was the little details that mattered. Things that Big Mac noticed after spending years around her. When he placed his hands on her shoulders, sure enough, the muscles were tense. </p><p>Applejack had always been the kind of girl to manifest her stress physically. Pacing back and forth, tapping her foot, her back and shoulders tensing up into a tight knot. As far as Big Mac was concerned, the best way to deal with the problem was to offer some physical relief and… maybe a little bit of brotherly wisdom. He began massaging Applejack’s shoulders. </p><p>Applejack groaned in relief. “How do ya always manage to hit all the right spots?” </p><p>“Yer mah baby sister and Ah know ya pretty darn well by now. That’s why.” </p><p>Applejack smiled and placed her hand atop Big Mac’s, rubbing it gently. “Thanks, Mac. Ah feel a heck of a lot better now. Heh. Almost half tempted ta go into town and git one o’ them fancy massages from the twins. Rarity was always ravin’ ‘bout ‘em back in high school.” </p><p>Big Mac slipped a pancake onto her plate and nodded. “Go on and do it then. Ain’t nothin’ stoppin’ ya. Look… Ah know you’re worried about us. But there ain’t no need fer ya ta rush yer decisions along. Just take things one day at a time. Growin’ up is a process not a race.” </p><p>“What ‘bout the farm, Mac? Ya know damn well that Granny ain’t gettin’ any younger. Ever since the day ma and pa died, Ah figured it’d be up ta us ta pick up the slack—”</p><p>The red-headed farmer let out a heavy sigh. “And ya have. Plenty. Nobody’s sayin’ ya haven’t put in a lot of hard work and made sacrifices ta keep Sweet Apple Acres runnin’ proper. Especially not me. All I’m sayin’ is that ya gotta go out ‘n enjoy yer youth while ya still can.”</p><p>Applejack crossed her arms underneath her breasts and huffed. “That’s the long n’ short of it! Ah ain’t some doe-eyed little girl anymore, Mac. I’m eighteen! A grown woman by most accounts. By mah reckonin’ that’s more than old enough ta start runnin’ the family business.” </p><p>“Fair enough. How do ya suppose yer gonna do that?” </p><p>Applejack rolled her eyes. “By goin’ ta college, of course! Learnin’ by practice is all well ‘n good but havin’ an actual degree and the skills that come with it is priceless. Don’t ya see? I’m thinkin’ ‘bout <b>OUR</b> future, Mac! Mah youth ain’t as important as mah family.” </p><p>Big Mac patted his sister’s shoulder. “We all appreciate the sentiment. But it’s just as important for ya ta be selfish every once ‘n a while too. Seriously, AJ. Ya deserve that much. S’not gonna kill ya ta go out ‘n have fun fer a change.”</p><p>Applejack’s expression softened. “Alright. Ah still haven’t broached the subject of college with Granny yet… but Ah plan ta soon. If there’s time, I’ll consider doin’ what ya said.” </p><p>The two siblings enjoyed the rest of their breakfast in relative silence until the pitter-patter of bare feet signaled their younger sister’s arrival at the table. With a tremendous yawn, Apple Bloom shuffled over to the coffee maker and poured herself a cup. Unlike Applejack, she was rather partial to flavored creamer and dumped a healthy amount of French Vanilla into her mug. It was clear by her unkempt hair and lack of a bow that she had not freshened up before breakfast. She set her mug down onto the table and plopped into a vacant chair. </p><p>“Tarnation. Do y’all have to be so noisy this early in the mornin’?” Apple Bloom groused. </p><p>Applejack leaned over and kissed her sister’s cheek. “Sorry, ‘Bloom. Didn’t mean ta wake ya up so early on a Saturday. We were… discussin’ a serious matter.” </p><p>“S’alright, AJ. Ah was gonna git up soon anyway.”</p><p>“How’s come?”</p><p>After a long swig from her mug, Apple Bloom sighed contentedly. “In case ya haven’t noticed, today’s the first day of summer vacation. Ah plan on hangin’ out with mah friends.” </p><p>“Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle?” Applejack asked. </p><p>“Eeyup! The one and only. Figured they’d enjoy comin’ over fer a swim. Ya know, since it’s gonna be so hot today.” </p><p>Applejack nearly choked on a chunk of pancake. “Now, hold on a dang second! Do yer friends know about us?”</p><p>Apple Bloom chuckled nervously. “Define: <i>know about us</i>.”</p><p>“Don’t play games with me, ‘Bloom. Ya know damned well what Ah meant!”</p><p>Apple Bloom blushed while she shuffled her feet underneath the table. “Ok, fine. The subject of our family bein’ naturists didn’t <i>EXACTLY</i> get broached durin’ the course of casual conversation yesterday afternoon. This was… kinda mah plan ta break the ice ‘bout it.” </p><p>“Lands sakes! Ah seriously don’t wanna deal with a couple of adolescent girls gawkin’ at us on account of the fact that they’ve never been around nekkid folks before. Apple Bloom, did ya even give yer plan the slightest amount of thought before ya invited ‘em over here?” </p><p>Apple Bloom blushed even harder. “I-I’m sorry, AJ! Ah got excited and didn’t realize how much of a problem it might cause. But we have ta at least give Sweetie ‘n Scoots a chance, right? Maybe it won’t be so bad. Maybe… they’ll be ok with us bein’ naturists.”  </p><p>Applejack rubbed her temples and sighed. “What time are they supposed ta come over?”</p><p>“Ah was thinkin’ right ‘round ten. That way, we can swim ‘n eat lunch afterwards.” </p><p>“Ok. We’ll give this a try. But don’t ya come belly-achin’ ta me if things get a might awkward.”</p><p>Apple Bloom nodded eagerly. “Ah promise Ah won’t! What’s the worst that could happen?”</p><hr/><p>True to her word, Applejack allowed her little sister’s friends to come over for a visit around ten. Despite the fact that she, herself, had not been very forthright about the family’s traditional lifestyle with her own classmates over the years. Applejack simply wasn’t in the mood to make accommodations for Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo. The main one being forced to wear clothing on account of offending average folks’ delicate sensibilities regarding modesty. They, along with Apple Bloom, would have to just deal with all the (<i>potentially awkward/embarrassing</i>) consequences that came with visiting a naturist household. </p><p>At the very least, Applejack reasoned, it would serve to teach Apple Bloom a valuable lesson. One that she wouldn’t soon forget if everything went according to plan. She would learn just how important it was to be honest with her friends and to let her family know of such visits in the future ahead of time. Nonetheless, Big Mac and AJ prepared some lemonade and baked goodies for their guests. At the very least, they wouldn’t be accused of being negligent hosts. </p><p>While AJ and Mac sat in a pair of rocking chairs on the porch, Granny Smith came out to join her grandchildren with a glass full of whiskey in one hand. The Apple Family matriarch looked as good as one could expect a nude, seventy-five-year-old woman to be. Her skin was tan and weathered but only slightly wrinkly. She, like her grandchildren, had a body teeming with wiry muscle. This made her look significantly healthier than the vast majority of people her age and had prevented her breasts from sagging too much. The only thing that really gave her age away was the fact that her hair (<i>tied in a bun</i>) was completely bone white. But otherwise, she could have easily been mistaken for a woman in her early fifties. </p><p>“Mornin’ youngsters. Ah hear tell that we’re expectin’ some guests.” </p><p>Mac nodded, while AJ walked over and gave her Granny a kiss. “Ya heard right. Apple Bloom got the notion that she could invite her friends over here fer a swim. Mind ya, Ah don’t care if she makes friends and wants ta do stuff with ‘em, but it was rude of her not ta tell us about it.” </p><p>Granny’s lips twisted into a sly smile. “Reckon Ah agree with ya, sugarcube. Yet, there’s a unique opportunity in the works. Ah sense ya recognized it too.” </p><p>Applejack returned to her seat and propped her feet up on the railing. “Eeyup. ‘Bloom’s gotta let her friends know how we like ta live. And that we ain’t gonna stop doin’ it just ‘cause it offends some folks. Gotta keep the Apple Family tradition alive, after all.” </p><p>“Seems ta me that a certain grandchild o’ mind has the <i>EXACT</i> same issue…” </p><p>Big Mac snickered. “Eeyup. Wonder who that might be?” </p><p>Applejack blushed. “Ah don’t—this ain’t—”</p><p>Granny took a swig of her whiskey and sighed. “Listen here, child. It ain’t mah intention ta make ya feel bad. I’m just worried about ya. When yer ma and pa died, ya had ta grow up in a hurry and over the years, Ah… feel like ya didn’t git ta enjoy yer childhood as much as ya should’ve.”</p><p>“It’s too late fer that now, Granny. I’m a grown woman…” </p><p>Granny Smith scoffed. “All in yer mind, Applejack. Lands sake, yer barely eighteen! What Ah want ya ta do is simple: spread yer wings, put yerself out there, and get to know folks better. We all appreciate how much hard work you’ve put into the Acres. Ain’t nobody denyin’ that.” </p><p>“What ‘bout Apple Bloom? She needs a childhood too!” Applejack pressed. </p><p>Big Mac rested his hand on Applejack’s thigh. “And she’s had a great one thanks to ya. Please don’t be mad, AJ. Ah took it upon mahself ta speak with Granny ‘bout you wantin’ ta go ta college. Figured it was better if the three of us discussed it openly like this.” </p><p>“How could ya have even known?! Ah just told ya ‘bout that this mornin’!” </p><p>“Wasn’t that hard ta figure out. Ya were always lookin’ at brochures and whatnot. Plus, ya tend ta leave ‘em sitting around yer room.” Big Mac admitted. </p><p>Applejack’s shoulders sagged. “Oh. Right. Guess Ah did…” </p><p>Granny Smith reached over and ruffled Applejack’s hair. “Tell ya what. I’ll make ya a deal. I’ll give ya mah blessin’ fer this whole college thing, hell, I’ll even pay fer yer tuition. But ya gotta promise me that you’ll try ta make some friends and be more forthright ‘bout bein’ a naturist. Ah know that you’ve run into some rough patches before with yer classmates but it ain’t healthy fer a young lady ta be a recluse here on the farm.” </p><p>Applejack looked down at her stomach and sighed. “It’s hard, Granny. Ah hate bein’ rejected n’ ridiculed just fer bein’ who Ah am. Don’t ya know how painful that is? Took me a long time ta get folks in high school ta stop thinkin’ Ah was some kind o’ perverted weirdo.” </p><p>“Of course, it’s hard. That’s just the way life is sometimes. But the way Ah see it, true friends are folks that stick by ya no matter how strange everyone else might think ya are. Besides, Ah can’t let mah sweet, beautiful granddaughter stay single forever…” </p><p>Applejack groaned. “Can we not talk about mah non-existent romantic ventures?”</p><p>“Fair enough. I’ll keep mah peace on that account,” Granny Smith agreed, “But how do ya know what bein’ in love is like when you’ve never gone and experienced it yerself? That goes fer you too, Mac. Ya ain’t gonna find a wife by haulin’ applewood around the farm all day long.” </p><p>A slight blush formed on Big Mac’s cheeks. “Eenope. Reckon not.” </p><p>Granny Smith leaned back in her chair and laughed. “It’s settled then! Y’all both need ta relax a spell and enjoy the spice of life. Keepin’ up the farm is important, don’t git me wrong. But ya only git ta be young once. Before ya know it, you’ll be an old coot like me.” </p><p>Applejack got up out of her chair, closed her eyes, and listened to the cicadas chirping amongst the trees. “Can’t promise that I’ll be good at it at first, but Ah can certainly give it mah best. Anywho… what’re we doin’ ‘bout the Scootaloo n’ Sweetie situation?” </p><p>Granny rubbed her chin in thought. “Much as Ah want Apple Bloom ta learn her lesson, it might be best if Mac n’ Ah stay inside. Seein’ the three of us together, bare nekkid, might be too much for ‘em ta process all at once. Don’t wanna scare the poor young’uns off, now.”</p><p>Applejack shuffled her feet. “Hey—umm—Mac, just try ta act casual around the girls, please? They’re at the age when they—EHEM—start noticin’ boys. And… well, you’re pretty noticeable when it comes to certain parts of the body, if ya know what Ah mean.” </p><p>“Wouldn’t be the first time, AJ. Ah can handle it.” </p><p>Applejack chuckled sheepishly. “Alrighty then! Guess I’ll wait near the front gate for ‘em.”</p><hr/><p>After a short bus ride in and out of town, Apple Bloom led her best friends along the dirt road towards Sweet Apple Acres. The bubbly excitement she’d felt earlier about spending the day with them had faded long ago. Now, all that remained was an impending sense of nervous discomfort, deep within the pit of her stomach. Despite only wearing a pair of flip flops and a yellow sundress, Apple Bloom had never sweat so much in her entire life. Well, that was actually an exaggeration. Farm work in the middle of summer was definitely way worse. </p><p>Apple Bloom gasped when she felt Scootaloo tap her on the shoulder. “Hey, AB. Are you sure you’re feeling ok? You look kind of… pale and sweaty.”</p><p>“Never better! I’m just plum excited ta go swimmin’ today. <b>EEYEP</b>!”</p><p>Scootaloo wasn’t convinced but didn’t want to pry any further out of respect for her friend. “Ok. But if there’s anything wrong, you let us know. Getting sick at any time of the year sucks. Even more so during summer.” </p><p>Sweetie nodded emphatically. “For sure! I’m just glad to get away from my sister. She was super cranky today for some reason. I think she was having some <i>REALLY</i> bad period cramps.” </p><p>Scootaloo grimaced. “Seriously, Sweetie? We didn’t need to know that.” </p><p>“Well, whatever. Didn’t you say that you bought a new swimsuit recently? Ooh! What does it look like? I wanna know what kind you got! C’mon, Scoots. You gotta tell me!”</p><p>With a slight blush, Scootaloo shifted the backpack straps along her shoulders. “Promise you won’t laugh?” </p><p>“I promise!” Sweetie squeaked. </p><p>“I usually get a one piece but—uh—this time, I decided to get a bikini. NOT… a super skimpy one or anything like that. Just something that’s functional and cool looking. Totally a normal thing to do, given the circumstances.” </p><p>Sweetie clapped her hands. “Neat! What color is it? And does it have frills?” </p><p>“Orange if you must know and it <u>DOES NOT</u> have frills.”</p><p>Apple Bloom cleared her throat. “So, what made ya decide ta wear a two piece?”  </p><p>Scootaloo rubbed the back of her neck and chuckled. “I dunno. One day, I saw Rainbow Dash wearing a teal bikini and figured that if she looked cool wearing one, then maybe I could too? Gah! That sounds stupid, doesn’t it? I don’t have the kind of figure to fill one out properly. Should’ve just stuck with the one piece. That’s better for tomboys like me…” </p><p>Apple Bloom wrapped her arm around Scootaloo and gave her a hug. “There ain’t nothin’ wrong with the way ya look, Scoots. Everyone’s different when it comes ta things like that. I’m sure you’ll look great in yer new bikini.” </p><p>The purple-haired tomboy blushed but a smile appeared on her lips. “Thanks, AB.”</p><p>“Don’t mention it.” </p><p>Sweetie let out a frustrated huff. “Are we almost there? I’m getting all gross and sweaty. Not to mention, I could really use a drink right about now. My mouth feels like it’s full of cotton.” </p><p>“Yeah, we’re almost at the front gate,” Apple Bloom affirmed, “But—umm—there’s somethin’ important Ah wanna tell y’all before we git there.”</p><p>The girls stopped and looked at their friend expectantly. </p><p>Apple Bloom twirled the end of her bow. “The thing is, there’s somethin’ about me and mah family that Ah don’t typically share with folks unless Ah trust ‘em. Ah just don’t want y’all ta be surprised by what ya see once ya finally meet Mac, Granny, and AJ.”</p><p>Scootaloo’s face paled. “You’re not cannibals, are you? <b>I DON’T WANNA BE LUNCH</b>!!” </p><p>Apple Bloom’s face turned red. An equal mixture of embarrassment, anxiety, and anger. “No, ya dummy! We ain’t flesh-eatin’ cannibals. But the way we live can be a bit… too much for some folks ta handle. Downright offensive ta others. What I’m sayin’ is that we’re naturists.”  </p><p>Scootaloo blinked owlishly. “Huh? Why’s that a big deal? My parents like to explore the world and look for animals. And you guys run a farm, so it makes sense that you’d like animals too.”</p><p>“No, Scoots,” Sweetie admonished, “that’s a <i>naturalist</i>. What AB’s talking about is a <i>naturist</i>. Basically, they’re people who prefer to be naked whenever and wherever they can.” </p><p>Scootaloo blushed. “Oh. Hehe… yeah, now I understand why some people might not be comfortable with that. SO—does that mean you walk around naked all the time too? I-I mean it’s <i>TOTALLY </i>cool if you do. Just a little… hard to wrap my head around. I guess that would explain why you’re always so comfortable when we’re changing in the locker room…” </p><p>Sweetie Belle reached over and held Apple Bloom’s hand. “Yeah! We’re BFFs no matter what! Even if that means your family is a little weird. But then again, who’s family isn’t?” </p><p>Apple Bloom let out a shuddering sigh of relief. “Thank goodness! Y’all have no idea how glad Ah am ta hear that. Ah was terrified that y’all wouldn’t want anythin’ ta do with me after Ah told ya what mah family was really like.”</p><p>“I’ll admit that it is a little weird, like Sweetie said. But why wouldn’t we want to still be your friend?” </p><p>Apple Bloom bit her lip. “Because some people think that since we’re nude all the time, we must be a bunch o’ perverts. I swear, it ain’t like that! Not wearin’ clothes is a heck of a lot more comfortable, saves money on laundry, and feels great! Especially, when yer out in the sun.” </p><p>Scootaloo chuckled awkwardly. “I’ll… just take your word for it, AB. In any case, I don’t think Sweetie or I are quite ready to commit to being naked today. But if taking off your clothes when we get there makes you feel more comfortable, I say go for it.”</p><p>“Thanks, girls. What y’all said sure means a lot ta me. Just as a fair warnin’ though, the rest of mah family are gonna be nekkid too. That includes mah older brother, Granny, and Applejack. I’m just sayin’ that y’all might want ta prepare yerselves mentally fer what yer ‘bout ta see.”   </p><hr/><p>Applejack slowly made her way out to the front gate, so that she could greet the girls. Had she been expecting any of their usual clientele (<i>distributors, delivery drivers etc</i>), the blonde farmer would have at least put on a pair of shorts and a flannel shirt to remain “<i>decent</i>” by modern society’s standards. Not that many of them were particularly bothered by her lack of attire. The Apple Family was well-known amongst the agricultural community for being naturists. Most of the other families they did business with simply took their nudity in stride. The price of dealing with the Apples, as it were. They tended to be respectful too. </p><p>Otherwise, Macintosh would have some choice words with them. He would potentially beat the absolute bejesus out of them too, if Apple Family honor demanded it. Even in the nude (<i>or especially because of it</i>), Mac was an intimidating mountain of a man. Standing at two hundred centimeters, he towered over most people. The moniker of “<i>Big</i>” was not ironic. It applied to everything else about him. He took such matters in stride, however. Preferring not to get upset over people gawking at him.</p><p>Her brother’s cool head and Zen-like demeanor was one of the many things that Applejack admired about him. She tended to lose her temper rather quickly in most situations, preferring to answer insults with a balled fist or swift kick to wherever she felt the offender deserved it most. She’d gotten better at dealing with her anger over the years (<i>with Mac’s help</i>) but there were times when she slipped and caused trouble. </p><p>Hands on her hips, and a wide smile on her lips, Applejack stood before Apple Bloom and her two friends. “Howdy! Y’all must be Sweetie Belle n’ Scootaloo. I’m Applejack but ya can call me AJ if ya prefer. If you’d kindly follow me, I’ll rustle up some refreshments.” </p><p>Sweetie and Scoots gave Applejack an awkward smile and simply nodded. They’d hoped that Apple Bloom was just kidding with them, but it became immediately apparent that she’d been telling the truth the whole time. Neither of them could figure out exactly what to say. Instead, they quietly followed along with rosy blushes coloring their cheeks. When they entered the kitchen, Mac and Granny were nowhere to be seen. Just a plate of apple fritters and lemonade set on the table especially for them. Without preamble, Apple Bloom kicked off her flip-flops and stripped out of her sundress as quickly as she could.  </p><p>“Feels good ta finally git outta that dang dress!” </p><p>Applejack motioned for Sweetie and Scootaloo to take a seat. “Ah finally git the chance ta meet mah sister’s friends. Go on, now. Don’t be shy. Y’all can have some treats if it suits yer fancy.”</p><p>Scootaloo carefully chewed on an apple fritter. “Heh. Yeah… umm—this is really good.” </p><p>“Thanks. Ah made ‘em mahself. An old Apple Family recipe. Secret’s in the butter. Gotta make sure it’s browned before ya add the apples n’ brown sugar. Gives it that nutty flavor.” </p><p>Sweetie took a big gulp of lemonade and coughed. “Oops! Went down the wrong pipe. Sorry if we’re not talking much, Miss Applejack. It’s just that we’re not—” </p><p>“Used ta seein’ nekkid folks?” </p><p>Sweetie nodded. “Not that I think there’s anything wrong with you! In fact, I think you’re really pretty. Your hair reminds me of corn silk. It’s so smooth and shiny! Have you ever considered modeling? You might be pretty good at it.” </p><p>Applejack blushed at the compliment. “Aw shucks. Awful kind of ya ta say so, Sweetie. But in case ya haven’t noticed, Ah ain’t real fond of fancy duds. Or any duds fer that matter.”</p><p>“No, I mean nude modeling. Like for art and stuff.” </p><p>Applejack furrowed her brow. “Nude modelin’? Uhh… Ah never gave it any thought, ta be honest. Don’t git me wrong; I’m plenty comfortable with mah body. But Ah can’t imagine too many people would want a muscled-up farm gal like me ta pose for ‘em.” </p><p>“I think you’d be surprised,” Sweetie squeaked, “my sister’s always telling me that variety is the spice of life. Maybe you’re just the kind of girl everyone needs for a change in perspective.” </p><p>“Huh. Well, that’s mighty thoughtful fer gal yer age. I’ll consider it, Ah suppose.” </p><p>Scootaloo tried her best to maintain eye contact with Applejack. “<b>SO</b>! Am I to assume that Apple Bloom isn’t going to be wearing a bathing suit when we go swimming?” </p><p>Apple Bloom shook her head. “Eenope. Hate bathin’ suits. Just a waste o’ soggy cloth that drags ya down in the water. Mah skin is the only suit I’ll ever need. Fits perfectly and dries off quick.” </p><p>“Alright. That’s fair, I guess. But—um—is it ok if we wear our suits?” Scootaloo asked. </p><p>Applejack shrugged. “Doesn’t bother me none. Do what ya please. You’re our guests and it’d be mighty rude of us ta force ya into doin’ somethin’ y’all weren’t comfortable with.” </p><p>Scootaloo let out a ragged sigh of relief. “Thanks. Sweetie and I aren’t… ready to start skinny dipping yet. Even if it’s just around you guys and Apple Bloom.” </p><p>Applejack walked up behind Scootaloo and patted her shoulder. “Like Ah said, Scootaloo. Ya don’t have ta conform ta our way o’ life while yer over fer a visit. Naturism ain’t fer everyone. Heck, if it were, we’d all be walkin’ ‘round nekkid as jaybirds right now.” </p><p>Apple Bloom puffed out her chest. “Scoots is just jealous ‘cause Ah got a decent patch o’ fuzz growin’ on mah lady parts and she doesn’t. Makes me look more mature, Ah reckon.”</p><p>Scootaloo turned beet red. “Yeah—well… my aunts say that I’m a late bloomer!”  </p><p>Sweetie Belle frowned. “Girls, can we <i>PLEASE</i> not argue over pubic hair?”</p><p>“Apple Bloom”, AJ admonished, “Yer friend is right. It ain’t nice ta make fun o’ the way people look. ‘Specially, when it comes ta their bodies. Some folks can’t help it. Go on and apologize. Ah know we raised ya better than that.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Scoots. Ah didn’t mean ta make fun o’ yer body. Mah sister’s right. Ah wasn’t thinkin’ ‘bout yer feelin’s when Ah made that remark. It was downright ignorant o’ me.”  </p><p>Scootaloo reached over and gave Apple Bloom’s shoulder a playful punch. “It’s ok, Bloom. We’re cool. I just have to learn to be patient is all. I’ll grow up when my body decides it’s the right time, not a moment before. Your—erm—fuzz does look good though. I think.” </p><p>Apple Bloom rubbed the back of her neck and chuckled. “Thanks, Scoots. Ah was half jokin’ when Ah said that but it’s nice ta know people think it looks good. Was worried that the other gals in class would think Ah was weird fer havin’ so much hair down there at mah age.” </p><p>Before Sweetie Belle could chime in, everyone’s attention was directed towards the creaking stairs. With a towel wrapped around his neck, Big Mac shuffled over to the fridge and cracked open a beer. He enjoyed his beverage in silence and gave everyone a simple nod to acknowledge their presence. Then he pulled out one of the chairs, sat down, and started nibbling on a fritter. </p><p>“Mornin’ ladies.” </p><p>Apple Bloom walked over to her brother and kissed his cheek. “Howdy, Mac.” </p><p>“These two the friends you were talkin’ ‘bout?” </p><p>“Sure are! The one sitting next ta ya is Sweetie and Scoots is across from her.” </p><p>Big Mac flashed them a warm smile. “Pleasure ta meet y’all. I’m Mac.” </p><p>“<b>YOU SMELL REALLY GOOD TODAY</b>!” Sweetie blurted out. </p><p>“Hmm? Reckon Ah do. Just came outta the shower.” </p><p>Scootaloo tried her best to avoid gawking at Big Mac but it was practically impossible. Not only because he was sitting with his legs slightly apart, but the <i>thing</i> dangling in-between them was unlike anything she’d ever seen before. “Gotta keep clean! Am I right?” </p><p>“Eeyup.”</p><p>“<b>I HAVE TO PEE</b>!” Sweetie shouted. </p><p>Not missing a beat, Scootaloo rushed over to her friend and grabbed Sweetie’s arm. “Hehehe. Imagine that! So, do I. All that lemonade’s gotta go somewhere, right? Hey, Bloom. Do you mind showing us where the bathroom is?” </p><p>Apple Bloom’s brow furrowed in confusion. “Uh… sure. It’s upstairs, first door on the right.” </p><p>“Thanks! We’ll be back before you know it!” </p><p>Once the bathroom door shut behind them, Sweetie Belle slumped onto the floor and buried her burning face in her hands. “Oh my gosh! His weenie was HUGE!” </p><p>“You didn’t have to say it like that but… yeah.”</p><p>Sweetie started sniffling. “And I acted like such a dork in front of him! Why didn’t Apple Bloom ever tell us that her brother was s-so… hot and <i>NAKED</i>. Scoots, I-I don’t think I can go back out there. It’s too much. I’ll just end up staring at his weenie again…” </p><p>Scootaloo’s cheeks flushed. “Well, you’re not the only one who noticed the heat he’s packing. And why on earth would Bloom ever tell us that? Big Mac is her brother for Pete’s sake! Do you go around telling everyone you know how hot your sister is?!”</p><p>Sweetie twiddled her fingers. “Not exactly.”</p><p>“My point stands. Look, I know it’s really hard to ignore but just try not to look down below his waist while we’re here. Maintain eye contact instead. That should help.”</p><p>Sweetie bit her lip. “Yeah but he has such beautiful green eyes. And that rugged, orange beard! I can’t help it, Scoots! I’ve got a mad crush on Apple Bloom’s brother!” </p><p>Scootaloo sighed. “No, that’s just your hormones talking because this is the first time you’ve ever seen a hot, naked guy in person before. Heh. Totally different from the internet…”</p><p>“Hey! It’s your first time too!” </p><p>Scootaloo coughed. “Maybe but that’s not the point. We just need to keep our shit together long enough until Apple Bloom shows us where the pond is. Then we can go swimming, relax, have fun, and forget about jumbo-sized hotdogs for a while. Does that sound like a plan?” </p><p>“Ok, I-I’ll try.” </p><p>Apple Bloom threw her hands into the air and huffed. “Ah knew this was gonna happen!” </p><p>“What? Ah didn’t do anythin’ wrong. Just took a shower and drank a beer.” </p><p>Apple Bloom gestured towards her brother’s waist. “It’s not that ya did anythin’ wrong, per say.”</p><p>Big Mac raised his brow. “Mah manhood’s always been like this. Can’t very well hide it. Not any more than ya can hide any part o’ yer body, Bloom.” </p><p>“Ah know. It’s just that—UGH—Ah told ‘em what ta expect before we got here. And now they’re all fidgety, blushin’ up a storm, and actin’ like a couple o’ twitterpated dopes.” </p><p>Applejack held up her hand. “Hold on a second, sugarcube. Did ya just say that ya told Sweetie n’ Scootaloo that we were naturists before they came over fer a visit?”</p><p>“Ah had ta, Applejack. They’d have freaked out otherwise.”</p><p>Applejack ruffled her little sister’s hair. “I’m proud of ya. That took a lot o’ guts.” </p><p>“Ah appreciate the compliment, but a fat lot o’ good it’s done me. They’ve been holed up in the bathroom fer ages. What the heck are they doin’ in there? Can’t take this long ta pee.” </p><p>Applejack gently nudged Apple Bloom towards the stairs. “Then git yer keister on up there and check on ‘em. Maybe they just needed some time ta sort things out. I’m sure they’re alright.” </p><p>“Ah suppose so,” Apple Bloom hesitantly agreed, “Hopefully, Ah can convince ‘em ta go swimmin’. Otherwise, this whole trip’ll have been a big ole waste o’ time.” </p><p>Applejack watched as her little sister plodded up the stairs towards the bathroom door. Their introduction to Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo could have gone a heck of a lot better, but it wasn’t too bad all things considered. At least the two of them hadn’t outright ridiculed Apple Bloom and called her a perverted freak for being a naturist. Whether intentional or not, Big Mac’s arrival had caused a ruckus. Understandable, given that they were just a couple of thirteen-year-old girls who’d (<i>probably</i>) never seen a real, live, grown man naked before. </p><p>Big Mac took a swig of his beer and sighed. “Should Ah try ta patch things up with ‘em?” </p><p>“Nah. Don’t bother. Let Apple Bloom handle it. Just do me a favor and keep yer distance when they go fer a swim. Wouldn’t want ‘em ta get all flustered again.” </p><p>“Eenope,” Big Mac agreed, “What’re ya gonna do in the meantime?”</p><p>“Ah dunno. Might join ‘em fer a swim mahself. Lord knows Ah could use a little time ta relax mahself. Ain’t gonna do me any good spinnin’ mah gears over this whole college thing.”</p>
