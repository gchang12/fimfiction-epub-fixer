		<h1>Fall Break Festivities (II)</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 12</b></p><p>Sweet Apple Acres, Ponyville<b> </b></p><p>“Remember, daring, if you need anything, don’t hesitate to call me,” Rarity reminded as Sweetie exited her sister’s fabulous purple Volkswagen Beetle. “I’ll be working with Micro to finish his gift for Sandalwood but naturally you come first. Did you bring sunscreen?” </p><p>“Yes, Rarity,” Sweetie replied, resisting the impulse to roll her eyes. Fussing over the little details very much ran in the Belle family. Grabbing her overnight bag from the back seat, she shouldered it. “I’ll be sure to apply enough.”</p><p>Rarity nodded, “Of course! Are you sure that outfit is appropriate?” </p><p>Sweetie looked down at the pastoral skirt and blouse combo she’d chosen, “I’ll change into something else if we do anything outdoors.” </p><p>“You’d better,” Her sister sniffed. “I don’t want to be mending any tears.” Smiling, she nodded. “Enjoy your sleepover, Sweetie. Remember to be patient with Scootaloo.” </p><p>“I will. Enjoy having the apartment to yourself, sis,” Sweetie teased with a wink.</p><p>“You’re terrible,” Rarity laughed as she put her car into gear. Waving, she yelled, “Love you!”</p><p>“Love you too!” Sweetie called after her sister, waving enthusiastically. As the car disappeared, Sweetie looked up at Sweet Apple Acres Gate. Apple Bloom had told her to wait for her to let them in. “Guess I’m waiting…” </p><p>Apple Bloom lowered her binoculars and beamed. The redheaded teen was crouched atop a grassy knoll, just out of Sweetie’s line of sight. Winona crouched beside her, fuzzy tail brushing up against her bare hip periodically.</p><p>“Now, we just gotta wait fer Scoots,” Apple Bloom beamed. “Then we’ll break the news while they’re off balance.” </p><p>Winona barked softly, licking her chops. </p><p>“Say girl, do ya think makin’ ‘em strip down is a good idea?” The girl asked, biting her lip. “Ah just know they’ll love the feelin’ but… what if mah request comes off as a might perverse?” </p><p>The Border Collie simply nuzzled her owner’s stomach. Apple Bloom giggled at the damp, ticklish sensation and scratched Winnona behind the ears, “Yer right girl. I’m thinkin’ too much.” </p><p>A minute later, while Sweetie aimlessly paced back and forth in front of the gate, Winona’s ears pointed upward and she looked down the road. Apple Bloom then heard the familiar sound of Scootaloo’s bike approaching. Rubbing Winona's back, she whispered, “Almost time.”</p><p>Scootaloo laughed as she coasted down the hill leading to Sweet Apple Acres. The tomboy stuck her long legs out on either side of her bicycle and let gravity do all the work. The wind from her passage ruffled the green T-shirt and orange cargo shorts she’d chosen to wear, along with her signature black biking helmet. She brought along a backpack stuffed with a spare set of clothes, some comic books, and assorted toiletries.  </p><p>When her momentum finally slowed, Scootaloo began to pedal once more. As she drew closer to the gate, a familiar figure turned to face her and raised a hesitant hand. Stomach knotting up, Scootaloo skid to a halt and dismounted. Removing her helmet, she held up a hand of her own.</p><p>“Scootaloo.”</p><p>“Sweetie Belle.” </p><p>Running her hand through her spiky hair, Scoots awkwardly asked, “How’ve ya been?” Since their spat, beyond a few terse words during their presentation, the two hadn’t spoken at all.</p><p>“Ok, I guess.” Sweetie couldn’t quite meet Scootaloo’s eyes. “I think Dinky might have a crush on Button Mash.” </p><p>“No kidding?! I thought you were sweet on him?” </p><p>Sweetie blew a strand of hair from her eyes, “A little bit. But he’s denser than a slab of concrete when it comes to girls.”</p><p>“Heh, yeah. Boys, amirite?” Wincing at how they were dancing around the issue, Scootaloo cleared her throat. “Listen, Sweetie.”</p><p>“Howdy gals!” Apple Bloom called out, breaking the tension. The two turned and flushed as their friend skipped towards them wearing nothing but her signature bow and a smile. Running beside her was Winnona who greeted the girls with a friendly bark and wagging tail. </p><p>“Hey, ‘Bloom,” Sweetie replied, waving.</p><p>“Sup, AB?” Scootaloo asked, glancing down the road. “Are you sure it’s a good idea to be running around… like that so close to the gate?” </p><p>The redhead opened up the gate carelessly, “Our neighbours are used ta it.”</p><p>Scootaloo shrugged as she began to walk her bike down the dirt road that led to the farm, “Whatever you say.” She was stopped by Apple Bloom’s leg. “Hey! What’s the big idea, blocking me like that?” </p><p>“Yer right, Scoots.” Apple Bloom placed her hands on her hips, doing her best to impersonate Applejack’s authority. “There’s one simple rule y’all gotta follow for this here sleepover.”</p><p>Sweetie cocked her head. “What are you talking about?” </p><p>Apple Bloom cleared her throat. “I’m afraid that Sweet Apple Acres is a clothes-free zone.” </p><p>“<b>WHAT</b>?!” Scootaloo clapped her hand over her mouth as her voice cracked. “What the hell, Apple Bloom?!” Sweetie openly gaped as their naturist friend stood firm in the grass. </p><p>“Ya heard me, Scootaloo. Fer this sleepover, skin is in. The Acres is the type o’ place that has no need fer secrets, drama, or modesty.” She smiled. “Think of it as a bondin’ experience that y’all will never forget. It’ll help ta strengthen our relationship as BFFs.” </p><p>Sweetie twirled one of her curls nervously. “I thought naturism wasn’t compulsory?”</p><p>Apple Bloom sighed, “I ain’t gonna force y’all ta take yer clothes off. It’s gotta be yer choice. Ah just know that we’d be a lot more honest with each other without a stitch between us. If that arrangement don’t suit yer fancy, Ah can have mah brother drive y’all back home.” </p><p>Scootaloo scowled, “There’s no way I’d--” </p><p>“Why not?” Scootaloo’s jaw snapped shut as she turned to regard Sweetie incredulously. The pale-skinned girl blushed and shrugged, “What? We know from last time nothing weird or perverted is going on. Besides, we owe Apple Bloom after all the drama we caused.” </p><p>As she began to unbutton her blouse, Apple Bloom smiled widely, “Ya sure, Sweetie?”</p><p>Sweetie smiled, “Of course I am. I’ll admit that I was curious about what it felt like but I didn’t have the nerve to actually try it.” To no one’s surprise, it turned out that she was wearing a frilly purple bra underneath her blouse. </p><p>Scootaloo swallowed, heart pounding in her chest, “Seriously?! You of all people?” Sweetie shrugged as she unclipped her skirt and stepped out of it, revealing a matching pair of panties. </p><p>“Just because I happen to like fancy clothes doesn’t mean I’m shy about my body.” The deep, rosy blush colouring her skin suggested otherwise. “What’s the matter, Scoots? You chicken?”</p><p>“No! I, just, I don’t…” Scootaloo stammered into silence as Sweetie unhooked her bra and took in a deep breath. She then slipped out her sandals, and kicked away her panties awkwardly, nearly tripping in the process. Flustered, she hugged herself and squeaked. </p><p>“Oh! Wow… this is a lot breezier than I imagined.” She yelped as Apple Bloom slammed into her side and gave her a bear hug. Or a bare hug, Scootaloo idly observed. </p><p>“Ya did it!” Apple Bloom beamed, “I thought fer sure Scootaloo would beat ya to it.” </p><p>Sweetie returned the hug. As they broke apart, Scootaloo studied Sweetie’s body. </p><p>It was clear that Sweetie Belle was developing into a young woman. Her breasts were noticeably rounder and fuller than Apple Bloom’s, and given her family’s genetics, she still had plenty of room to grow. Her hips and backside were also curvier than Apple Bloom’s work-hardened physique, with a slight bit of paunch gathered around the center of her stomach. A wispy, curly tuft of purple-pink hair peaked from in-between her legs. </p><p>“Scoots? Ya in there?” Apple Bloom asked, snapping her fingers. Scootaloo jumped, realizing that she’d been openly gawking at her friend’s naked body. “Are you in or not?” </p><p>Scootaloo hung her head and shuffled her feet in the grass, “I-I don’t know. I’m not… like you girls. I don’t look good naked. I should probably… just go.” She turned and made to mount her bike. </p><p>“Wait!” Sweetie ran awkwardwardly towards her friend, unused to having everything jiggle around in the open so much. “You can’t just wimp out on us!”</p><p>“You don’t even want to hang out with me anymore!” Scootaloo spat. “Just let me go!”</p><p>Sweetie wrapped her arms around Scootaloo’s waist and refused to budge. “No! You might be a dummy sometimes, but I still love you! If I can get naked, then so can you!”</p><p>Scootaloo slumped, “But I’m all gangly and...” </p><p>Apple Bloom sighed. “This again? Scoots you-” She stopped as Sweetie shook her head. </p><p>“Do you know how many people would kill to have a flat tummy like yours?” Sweetie began gently. “Look at me; I’m practically turning into a marshmallow! I have to buy new underwear every month with how much these stupid things are growing.” She emphasized her point by cupping her breasts. “You’re still a girl though! Just different. Everyone is.”</p><p>Scoots rubbed her watery eyes, “No matter what I try, I still look like a boy.” She clenched her fists and got off of her bike. “Ok fine! I’ll try it!” She flashed a grin. “If Sweetie can do it, then so can I!” She grabbed the hem of her shirt and paused, gathering the courage to remove it. </p><p>Apple Bloom smiled. “Ya got this, Scoots. We’re here fer ya.”  Sweetie simply nodded and crossed her arms underneath her breasts. </p><p>Scootaloo whipped off her shirt and threw it in the air. The tomboy had opted to go braless for the ride over and now her bare chest was exposed to the open air. Despite her fears, Sweetie and Apple Bloom noticed that Scootaloo did indeed have breasts above her toned stomach. Albeit they were much smaller by comparison. </p><p>Shaking, Scootaloo kicked her shoes off as she unzipped her shorts. She slid them off of her narrow hips and down her long, muscular legs. As she stood up, Apple Bloom and Sweetie couldn’t help but giggle. Rather than boxers, Scootaloo was clad in a pair of cute yellow panties with cats printed all over, not unlike something Sweetiee would wear. </p><p>“What? I like feeling cute…” Scoots muttered as she pulled on the garment. “Ok. Here I go!” Practically jumping out of her underwear, she threw it away and stood naked before her friends. Not a spec of hair was to be found below her waist. “What do you think?”</p><p>Apple Bloom carefully gave her friend a hug, marvelling at the firmness of her muscles, “Ah think Rumble would have a cow if he saw ya like this.” Scootaloo snorted as she returned the hug with equal affection. The two girls smiled as Sweetie joined them in a group hug. </p><p>Breaking apart, Scootaloo swallowed and looked around, “Never thought I’d work up the nerve to do something like this…” Bouncing on her heels she smiled hesitantly. “The wind, the sun, everything feels so much more vivid. I--um--kind of like it, I think…” </p><p>Apple Bloom beamed, “Told ya. Ah reckon we should head on over ta the house, unless y’all want ta give the next passerby a show.” Turning, she looked at Winnona who was busy ruffling Sweetie's skirt. “And before Winona chews up your clothes! Git away from ‘em, ya ornery pooch!”</p><hr/><p>Big Mac waved at the approaching red sedan, which honked its horn in greeting. The large farmer wore a simple plaid shirt, a pair of well worn jeans and hiking boots. He’d taken along a backpack filled with a light lunch, a water bottle, and sunscreen. Mac chewed on a wad of gum nervously, unsure how Daisy Mae would react, and in turn, what would happen between them. </p><p>While he was doing his best to act casual by leaning against a tree, inwardly Mac’s heart was racing like a formula one dragster. Getting the chance to spend a whole day with Daisy Mae was exciting enough but the prospect of her doing so au natural, raised the stakes considerably. Pushing himself off the tree, he walked towards the back gate and opened it as Cheerliee’s car approached. The teacher waved at him as she drove through and parked. </p><p>Mac closed the gate and locked it carefully. While crime was hardly an issue in the valley, it didn’t pay to be careless. Turning to the sound of her door opening, Mac called out, “Seems ya found the place without any trouble.”  </p><p>Mae’s voice came from the car, “Of, course! I nearly got lost in the beautiful scenery though.”</p><p>“Eeup. That it is.” Mac replied as Mae exited her vehicle. The young woman was dressed in a pink t-shirt, khaki shorts and a pair of practical boots not unlike Mac’s own. Her hair was tied back in a sensible ponytail with a pair of hot pink sunglasses resting upon her forehead. “Your presence here today only enhances the experience, I’d say.” </p><p>“The same could be said for you,” She replied with a playful wink as she removed a backpack of her own. Closing the door, she walked up to him and planted a gentle kiss on his lips. Mac returned the favour, placing his hands on her hips before she broke off the embrace. </p><p>“Mighty kind of ya, Mae. Ah hope yer ready fer an excitin’ hike today. Ah packed some food fer a picnic, if yer so inclined.” He smiled. “Ah know the perfect spot up in the hills mah parents used ta frequent when they were still around.” </p><p>Mae grinned, “Sounds like a nice day to me.” </p><p>“Shall we?” </p><p>“W-wait,” Cheerliee stuttered before clearing her throat. “Why aren’t you naked?” Mac turned and blinked at the expression on her face. “This is your property, right? So, why the clothes?”</p><p>The farmer chuckled and rubbed the back of his head, “Ah didn’t want ta pressure ya ta take yours off right away. Figured we could ease into it later, dependin’ on yer mood.”</p><p>His girlfriend put her hands on her hips and smiled. “That’s very considerate of you, Macintosh but I didn’t come here to just go out on a long hike. I came here to enjoy nature as nature intended. If you don’t mind, I’d prefer to plunge right in. Otherwise, I might lose my nerve... “   </p><p>A warm feeling blossomed in Mac’s chest. “Mae, what are ya-”</p><p>The teacher dropped her bag to the ground and grabbed the hem of her shirt. Winking at him, she replied. “Shh. Just live in the moment and let me do my thing.” </p><p>Truth be told, Daisy-Mae’s decision to strip was mostly bravado. The teacher had been running through several scenarios of how she’d address the pink elephant in the room during her journey to Sweet Apple Acres. She’d even considered driving completely nude but common sense had prevailed. No, the best way to go about it was to take everything off as soon as she arrived. It was a lot like jumping into the deep end of the pool. </p><p>Mac became flustered as Mae began to remove her T-Shirt, but a shy smile remained on his lips. On a sudden playful impulse, she began to shake her hips as she slowly pulled her shirt off. Mae carefully slipped it over her head and shook out her hair. She’d chosen to wear a plain, black sports bra that wasn’t exactly sexy, but did a good job of highlighting her assets. Sticking her tongue out, Cheerliee winked. “Enjoying the show so far?” </p><p>“Reckon you’d be hard-pressed ta do it wrong,” Mac chuckled. </p><p>Upon taking her bra off, Daisy Mae twirled it around and flushed as her breasts jiggled slightly and came to rest. Ever since she was a teenager, she’d been generously endowed but exercise and diet had kept her breasts nice and firm. Her perky pink nipples began to stiffen as the breeze tickled them. She stuffed the bra in her backpack and moved on to her shorts. </p><p>She undid the button and zipper, and glanced over at Mac. While he was doing his best to appear nonchalant, the blush forming on his cheeks confirmed that he was very much enjoying the show. Sliding the shorts over her boots, the only thing she wore beyond footwear were her black panties. Abruptly, a wave of nerves hit her like a wrecking ball and her smile faltered. </p><p>“Ya don’t have ta go all the way,” Mac remarked, reaching out a hand. </p><p>“This is something I must do!” Mae looped her fingers around the waistband of her panties.With a deep breath, she carefully shimmied out of them. Knowing that her bare backside was facing Mac, Mae bent over a little more than was strictly necessary. Smirking at the sudden intake of breath, she tossed her garments aside and turned to face him. She’d made sure to groom herself properly last night and hoped he liked it. “What do you think?”</p><p>Mac snuck a peek at the mulberry strip nestled in-between her toned legs and blushed. “Reckon ya rendered me speechless. Not sure if Ah can say anythin’ that would do yer beauty justice.” Shrugging he reached for his own shirt. “Suppose Ah ought ta let ya see me nekkid. Fair is fair.” </p><p>“Wait!” Mae cried as she ran forward towards Mac. “Could I do it?” She placed her hands on his chest and batted her eyes, in what she hoped was a disarming way. </p><p>The farmer stopped unbuttoning his shirt. “If that’s what ya want, don’t see no harm in it.” </p><p>Linking her arms around the back of his neck, Mae kissed his neck. Her heart was beating fast with excitement and anticipation. Breaking this kiss, she smirked as she felt his own heartbeat through the fabric of his shirt. </p><p>“Excited?” Mae whispered, grabbing the hem of his shirt. “Arms up, big boy.” Giggling, she pulled it up and over his broad, hairy chest, shoulders, then finally his head. Stepping back, Mae fidgeted in place and resisted the urge to let her jaw drop as she looked at his bare torso.  </p><p>Mac scratched his chest, “What? You’ve seen me shirtless before.” </p><p>“Not in person, and certainly not this close,” Cheerliee replied, reaching out. “May I?” At his shrug, she ran her hands over his pecs and abs with a goofy grin. He was every bit as sturdy as she’d imagined, more so even. “You’re built like a superhero!” </p><p>“Honest work is all it is, m’am. No masks or tights required.”</p><p>Mae let out a half-snorting giggle while she began to unbuckle his belt. Once she was finished undoing the zipper of his pants, Mae helped him step out of them, as carefully as she could. He was now clad in only a pair of grey boxers with a rather large bulge protruding from them. </p><p>Mae glanced up at his flushed face. “Hmm~ What do we have here?” </p><p>Mac gave her a look that spoke volumes. Waving her hand, she muttered, “Oh, alright. I’ll get on with it.” Licking her lips in anticipation, she grabbed his underwear and yanked them down. When his manhood bounced free, she couldn’t help but gasp. </p><p>In high school, there had been more than a few jokes that the nickname ‘Big Mac’ referred to more than just his impressive stature. Some girls had whispered that he was hung like a horse and never failed to satisfy any woman he pleased. Mae had to admit that Mac’s member had been the subject of many speculative, late night fantasies.</p><p>The genuine article, while impressive, was not as ridiculously large as rumors had led her to believe. Macintosh was well-endowed; no doubt about that. Not only lengthwise, but in sheer girth. Upon closer inspection, she noticed that it was rather veiny too. Mae squeaked when she realized that Macintosh was reacting to her presence in the most honest way a man could. </p><p>“Someone’s happy to see me.” </p><p>Mac coughed awkwardly, face beet red, using his hands to conceal his growing erection, “Hells Bells! I’m sorry Mae. Just gimme a minute ta get things back under control.”</p><p>In a bid to make him feel better and, if Mae was honest, to tease him, she pressed her breasts up against his back and wrapped her arms around his chest. Kissing him on the back of his neck she smiled, “I’m not upset. If anything, I’m flattered. Besides, if you didn’t get hard after the show I gave you, I’d be a little worried you weren’t interested in me.” </p><p>Mac removed his hands, revealing his semi-turgid penis. “Ain’t no use in hidin’ it then…” </p><p>Mae felt his heart begin to slow down and his breathing became regular once more. Smirking, she nibbled on his ear and whispered, “If you play your cards right, I might consider getting to know him <b>A LOT</b> better, if you know what I mean~” </p><p>“Erm--is that so?” </p><p>Faces flushed, the couple broke their embrace and stored their discarded clothing in the backpacks. As they moved around, Mae noted Mac’s erection had begun to subside, along with his blush. Now that the initial excitement had played itself out, Mae enjoyed the feeling of the sun and wind on her bare skin. Shouldering her backpack, she donned her sunglasses. </p><p>“Ready?” Mac asked. </p><p>“Lead on!” Mae replied while taking hold of his hand. </p><hr/><p>Scootaloo stretched as she exited the farm house. While she’d be lying if she said she was completely comfortable walking around in the buff, she enjoyed the warmth of the sun and the breeze as it tickled her skin. There was something oddly satisfying about being able to be herself without having to worry about what to wear. Just a simple tomboy who loved sports.  </p><p>A soft hum drew her attention to Sweetie. The curvier girl had plopped herself onto a hammock strung up on the porch and was swinging in place with a childish smile. Smirking, Scootaloo walked over and leant on the railing beside her. </p><p>“Having fun ‘creampuff?’” </p><p>Sweetie snorted, “So what if I am?” The two giggled before falling into silence. Biting her lip, Sweetie added. “Thanks for staying this time…”</p><p>The taller girl sighed, “It was only ‘cause you were so brave. Sure didn’t expect you to just take all of your clothes off so willingly.” </p><p>“Apple Bloom is right; it is rather freeing. I figured, what’s the worst that could happen?”</p><p>Scootaloo squinted dramatically off into the distance, “Someone from school taking pictures of us and posting them online?” At Sweetie’s scandalized snort she winked. “Bet THAT would get Button to pay attention to you.” </p><p>“Not in the way I want...” The two snickered as Scootaloo hopped on top of the railing beside the hammock. The old polished wood felt nice beneath her bum and was mercifully free of splinters. As she swung her legs Sweetie cleared her throat.</p><p>“Scoots, don’t take this the wrong way, but why don’t you have any hair… down there?”</p><p>The tomboy glanced down at her smooth skin and chuckled. “I have gone through puberty, despite my body type. If that’s what you’re asking...”</p><p>“No! I didn’t mean to imply--.”</p><p>“The simple answer is that I wax my pubes regularly. Rainbow says it’s more practical for athletes to be hairless. Supposed to give you an ‘<i>edge</i>’.” Scoots ran her fingers over her crotch briefly. “I love the feel of it, ya know? And the look’s grown on me.” She gestured towards Sweetie’s own crossed legs. “Kind of figured you’d spruce up more down there.” </p><p>Sweetie twirled a few strands of her hair in-between her fingers. “I think having at least some pubes makes you look more ladylike. My sister likes to trim her’s into shapes sometimes, like a diamond. I dunno about waxing or shaving. Sounds like it would be painful... “ </p><p>“Ah see it as a mark o’ maturity. A sign o’ reachin’ womanhood.” Apple Bloom remarked as she opened the porch door with her foot. In her hands the redhead bore a tray of refreshing apple cider.</p><p>Scootaloo snagged one of the drinks and shrugged. “To each their own, I guess.” </p><p>Sweetie giggled as she accepted her own glass. “Mine’s never grown that thick before. Must be a genetic thing. Kind of like with my mom and her boobs.”  </p><p>“Ah trim ‘em on occasion! Ah just don’t feel the need ta draw any extra attention ta mahself down there. Natural is best.” The naturist pouted, throwing back half her drink in one go. </p><p>“In any case, a full bush suits you.” Scootaloo remarked. </p><p>Apple Bloom smiled widely, “Thanks. Can’t say I’d ever consider goin’ smoothie, but it works for ya, Scoots. What’s the word I’m lookin’ fer? It accentuates all yer muscles and whatnot.” As her tomboyish friend hid her blush with her drink she turned and sat beside Sweetie in the hammock.</p><p>As they finished their drinks, Apple Bloom clapped her hands, “What do you girls wanna do, now that we’ve gotten past the awkward adjustment phase?”</p><p>“What does a nudist do on a day such as this?” Scootaloo asked, setting aside her glass. </p><p>“Chores, usually,” Apple Bloom responded dryly. “But it’s vacation time! How would ya girls like ta see something cool?” Her friends shared a look then nodded. “Well, follow me!” </p><p>Leaving their drinks behind, the trio of teenagers plus Winona headed out to the orchard. As they walked, the three chattered about class, their sisters and their teacher. Scootaloo and Sweetie gasped as Apple Bloom regaled them with second hand tales of Mac’s big date. </p><p>“Awww, that’s so romantic,” Sweetie gushed, clasping her hands together. “Miss Cheerilee really is lucky your brother is such a gentleman.” </p><p>Scootaloo cackled, “Just wait till she sees what he’s packing! He’s gonna plow her field REAL good.” The tomboy thrust her hips suggestively, much to Sweetie's outrage. </p><p>Growling in mock anger, Apple Bloom wrapped Scootaloo in a headlock and noogied her, “Ya take that back! Mah brother is gentle as a lamb!” </p><p>“Ok, ok, geez just a joke AB!” As she was released Scootaloo skipped out of reach. “A lamb with a monster dong, you mean.” </p><p>Laughing, the trio left the shade of the orchard and emerged into a grassy clearing. At its center was a towering old apple tree, one of the first ones planted by Granny Smith’s grandparents all those years ago. Built into its boughs were several platforms connected by bridges and ropes. At the centre of the complex was a full-on treehouse complete with windows, a door and a colourful coat of red paint. </p><p>“Yoooooo,” Scootaloo said, running ahead. “How have you NEVER brought this up?!”</p><p>“How long has this been here?” Sweetie asked, studying the treehouse. “Some parts look pretty old.”</p><p>“Granny’s parents were the ones who first worked on it, years back,” Bloom replied. “Since then, every generation has added to it. Me and Babs actually repainted it last time she was here.” The farmgirl blushed. “As for why Ah never showed ya before.” She pointed to a sign hanging above the treehouse door written in a childish hand that proudly stated: <i>NO </i><i>KLOTHES</i><i> ALLOWED</i>. </p><p>Scootaloo laughed, “Yeah, that might’ve taken some explaining. Say, is Babs a nudist too?”</p><p>“Eeyup,” Apple Bloom answered with a warm smile. “She’s the only one in her branch of the family. Unfortunately, there ain’t a whole lot o’ places ta practice the lifestyle in Manehatten. She loves visitin’ Sweet Apple Acres whenever she can though.”</p><p>Sweetiee shook her head, “And here I thought she happened to like our company.”</p><p>“Of course she likes us, ya goofball! Anyway, are we gonna stand around like a couple of worried hens or we gonna check our clubhouse out?”</p><p>“Ours?” Sweetiee and Scootaloo asked in unison.</p><p>Apple Bloom flushed, “Y’all are like sisters ta me and Ah figured maybe if ya take a shine to being naked we could hang out here more often.” She coughed. “If that ain’t weird.”</p><p>Scootaloo sighed, “While we’re confessing things… screw it, I’m sorry for being such a turd to both of you.” The tomboy blinked rapidly. “From here on out, I promise not to blow you guys off for Rainbow anymore.” </p><p>For a few seconds silence stretched between the trio before a sob broke the silence. Unlike her more stoic Tomboy friend, Sweetiee freely allowed herself to tear up as she pulled at her hair.</p><p>“S-s-scootaloo, I should be apologizing to you! I treated you like such a cold hearted b-bitch! I was so upset but that doesn’t excuse it! C-can you forgive me?” The curvy girl rubbed her eyes as tears leaked down her cheeks. </p><p>The taller girl strode over and wrapped her in a hug. Scoots sniffed and muttered, “You drama queen. There’s nothing to forgive. We were both shitty, let's leave it at that.” Any thoughts of embarrassment had long since fled her mind as she hugged her friend tight. </p><p>“Well…” Sweetiee replied, returning the hug. “I should probably also not be so clingy. Even if we don’t hang out all the time, that doesn’t mean we’re not best friends.” The two nodded and smiled before the clapping of hands caused them to look up.</p><p>“Ah love you girls!” Apple Bloom declared as she wrapped both of them in a hug as well. Scootaloo and Sweetie made sounds of mock protest at the farm girl’s intrusion. “Ah just knew you two would sort things out buck nekkid!”</p><p>Scootaloo snorted, “Yeah, yeah you got lucky, Bloom.” Clearing her throat she muttered. “But thanks for not giving up on us.”</p><p>After a good minute the trio broke the hug and wiped their eyes. Clapping her hands together Scootaloo declared, “Right now would you girls like to help me launch myself off that tire swing like a total BAMF?” Laughing, the three raced off to play, unbridled joy upon their faces.</p><hr/><p>“You got it?” Mac grunted, sweaty chest gleaming in the sun.</p><p>“Yeah,” Daisy Mae replied with a sigh. “I’m not gripping it too hard am I?”</p><p>Looking down at her Mac winked, “Those soft hands of yours? Course not. On three?”</p><p>The young teacher spread her legs and nodded, “One.”</p><p>Mac’s muscles tensed in preparation, “Two.”</p><p>“Three!” They said as one. </p><p>Mac’s bicep muscles bulged as he lifted Cheerilee up the debris pile. His date, for her part, kicked her legs out finding a toehold to aid her ascent. The sun was warm in the dry ravine bed and they both were sweating. </p><p>With a final burst of effort, the two fell back atop the boulder Mac had been standing upon. By accident or design, Cheerliee had landed half atop him, her breasts rubbing against his pecs. Smiling Mac rested a hand on her lower back and remarked, “Well ain’t this a happy accident?” With a burst of boldness, he moved his hand to her bottom and gave it a good squeeze.</p><p>Mae caressed the side of his face, “Well aren’t you the rogue. I took you for a gentleman!”<br/>Giggling, she kissed him tenderly. “There’s your reward, you chivalrous brute.”</p><p>The two laughed as they rolled away from one another and got up. Looking down the ravine Mac scratched his chest, “Mah apologies again, Mae. Ah hadn’t realized we had a rock slide out here this spring.”</p><p>Mae unclipped her water bottle from her bag and took a swig, “It’s fine, Mac. The view makes it all worth it.”</p><p>“Eeyup.” </p><p>Spread out before them was Sweet Apple Acres in its entirety. Rows of apple trees stretched out almost as far as the eye could see; their boughs empty for the moment. The distillery, barn, root cellar, farmhouse, and even the old treehouse all blended seamlessly into the natural landscape. The swimming hole reflected sunlight playing upon the nearby trees. A soft breeze stirred the treetops creating a murmur they could hear even up the butte. </p><p>After catching their breath, Mac and Cheerliee moved on and headed further up the hill and into a thicket of trees and creeping vines. As they were now able to walk side by side, Daisy-Mae took his hand in her own tenderly. Mac marveled at how soft and dainty it felt and did his best not to crush her with his own monster paw of a hand. </p><p>“Did ya enjoy the hike?” He asked, rubbing the back of his head with his free hand. “Ah hope it wasn’t too technical…”</p><p>Mae shook her head. “I’m having plenty of fun, Mac. Sweet Apple Acres is so tranquil and flush with the bounty of nature. Almost like the Garden of Eden.” She bumped his hip with her own. “We’re even dressed for the part, huh?”</p><p>The big man chuckled, “Ah’m sure Ah could rustle up some fig leaves somewhere…”</p><p>Cheerliee grinned while glancing down towards his waist. “No need~ We’re perfectly fine as is. Besides, I don’t think there’s a fig leaf big enough to cover up a serpent like that. Where are you taking me now?”</p><p>“Just the edge o’ our property,” At her hand gripping his own tighter he smiled reassuringly. “Don’t ya worry, no one comes up this way but us Apples.”</p><p>“That’s a relief! I think I like being naked in a private setting but anything more is...”</p><p>“Ah understand” The big man pushed aside some hanging creepers and pulled Mae forward. “Looks like we’re here.”  </p><p>The couple emerged into a secluded clearing atop the rocky hill. Around them the rest of the grove of trees hung back leaving the ground covered only in soft moss. In the centre of the clearing a tree grew that made Mae do a visible double take. </p><p>“That’s impossible!”</p><p>Mac smirked at her wonder as he studied the familiar old tree himself. Or rather, the two trees that had grown together into one. Half of the twisted trunk was the familiar dark brown wood of most apple trees with lush verdant green leaves. The other half was a pale grey with the light green leaves of a pear tree. By some accident of creation the crowns of the two trees mingled in such a way to form the shape of a heart. </p><p>“Enope. That there is a genuine <i>pearple</i> tree.”</p><p>Releasing his hand, Mae raced over to the tree in a way that made her bare buns jiggle in a very distracting way. Crouching down onto her haunches, she ran her hands along the trunk of the hybrid tree. Mac walked up beside her as she muttered, “They’ve grown together. Practically like a symbiotic organism! How did this happen?”</p><p>Mac’s fingers fondly rubbed an old carving at his eye level. It was a simple heart that had two familiar initials contained within: BM+PB. “The magic of love, that’s how.”</p><p>Mae cocked her head, “That’s not exactly an answer, Macintosh…”</p><p>“I’ll tell you about it over lunch. Apple or pear?” Unlike the trees in the orchard, this tree had yet to be harvested. While the fruit was a little ripe it was still more than edible.</p><p>“That some kind of test?” Mae quipped, taking her backpack off. “An apple, thank you.”</p><p>Picking both an apple and a pear gently, Mac walked over to Mae as she spread a blanket out on the mossy ground. The two removed their lunches, a pair of sandwiches, from their bags and sat down side by side. Giving her the apple, Mac bit into his pear and began the story.</p><p>“Mah family’s worked this land fer generations. When we came over from the old country, my great grandpappy wanted tah live as close ta nature as possible,” He paused to enjoy the tart squishy texture of the pear. “Back then, naturism wasn’t exactly mainstream, much less accepted by the masses. Over time though, folks began ta accept us fer how we lived.” </p><p>Mae nodded as she bit into the apple, juice running down her chin and onto her breasts. Coughing, he resumed the story holding up the fruit in his hand, “Except for the Pears. They used ta own the land on the other side of this Butte and always had it in fer us. Said we were immoral Canaanites, wanton exhibitionists and other such nonsense.” </p><p>“They couldn’t have been friendly neighbors then,” Mae remarked, cleaning the spilled juice with a towelette. “How do your parents fit into all this?”</p><p>“As time went on, the feud kept on gettin’ worse. Ah’m pretty sure at one point Granny and Grand Pear came tah blows,” He shook his head. “By the time my parents were born,both families weren’t even on speakin’ terms.”</p><p>The teacher grinned as she began to dig into her sandwich, “Do I sense a forbidden romance story in the works?”</p><p>Mac winked, “Maybe.” Finishing off the pear, he flicked the core away. “When mah parents were wee tots, they happened tah run into one another. Pa was running around with nothin’ but a smile and ma was quite scandalized at first. However, they got along like peanut butter n’ jelly. Before long, ma stopped feelin’ so self-conscious and went full jaybird.”</p><p>“Hmm. That can’t have gone over well with her folks.”</p><p>“Eenope. Grand Pear damn near burst a blood vessel chewing pa out. Granny was furious with Grand Pear fer oversteppin’ his bounds. After that day, the two families agreed to never let the two meet again.” He shrugged. “Course, my parents had other ideas. The two of them snuck out one night and climbed up here. They resolved to stay friends and planted an apple and pear seed on this here spot ta symbolize their bond.” </p><p>“Awwwww, that’s so sweet.”</p><p>Gently caressing the side of Mae’s face, Mac remarked, “Course, as time went on the two became sweet on one another n’ ended up engaged. The trees themselves grew together over time. An everlastin’ symbol o’ their love. Eeyup. Real romantic, Ah reckon.” </p><p>The young couple kissed chastely before returning to their meals. Nudging Mae with his arm, Mac asked, “How’d yer parents meet?”</p><p>Mae snorted, “Nothing quite as dramatic as yours, I’m sure.  My dad met my mom at a singles night at the bar Berry Punch runs in town. One drink led to another and they hooked up.” She shrugged. “When I came along, my dad decided to make mum an honest woman. For a one night stand, it worked out pretty well, all things considered.” </p><p>Mac felt his face brightening with heat, “Ahh, shucks Mae ah didn’t mean-”</p><p>His girlfriend waved her hand, “It’s fine, Mac. I dare say dad will tell you himself next time they’re in town.” Mae’s expression soured. “That is, if they ever leave that damn swingers resort they retired to…”</p><p>Laughing awkwardly, the two finished their meal before lying back on the blanket together. As they stared up at the rustling leaves of the tree, Mae began to entwine her legs around Mac’s. Smiling, he slipped his arm under her neck so she could rest her face beside his own. Her gaze was wistful as her hands stroked his chest.</p><p>“Having fun?” Mac asked hesitantly. </p><p>Mae hummed and pressed her breasts against his chest, “For a second date? Absolutely.” Kissing him with passion she broke off and looked him in the eye. “Do you think we could just… lay here together for a bit? And make out like a couple of ‘<i>forbidden lovers</i>’?”</p><p>“Eyup.” Mac kissed her again as their hands roamed across each other’s bodies. His manhood began to stir to life atop his abs, but he ignored it. The full feeling in his heart, for now, trumped any other desire as he embraced Mae with all the love he had.</p><hr/><p>Daisy Mae realized that still had a goofy grin spread across her lips as she followed Mac back onto Sweet Apple Acres proper. The big hunk had proven to be a surprisingly good kisser. Not that Mae had expected him to be a hayseed at it but his tongue was both dexterous and firm. She could only imagine what he could do with it elsewhere...</p><p>Shaking the lewd thoughts from her mind, Mae skipped up to walk beside Mac as they passed through one of the outer orchards. Truth be told, she’d had trouble resisting the urge to jump on top of him and ride him like a cowgirl. Only the lack of condoms and their mutual desire to take things slow had kept her lustful impulses at bay. As she ducked under a bough, she dimly realized Mac had said her name.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Mac. Could you say that again?”</p><p>“Ah was asking if ya wanted to take a dip in the pond? Good way ta refresh yerself after a hike.”</p><p>Mae made a show of sniffing her armpit, “What, do you think I’m smelly?” She pulled a face. “Still, rinsing all the sweat and dust off my skin wouldn’t hurt. Lead on!” </p><p>Mac made a show of bowing, “After you.” </p><p>As they drew closer to the pool, the sound of young laughter echoed through the trees. Mae paused as she felt a wave of panic wash over her. Surely, no one but Mac’s family was here? Instinctively hiding behind him, she peered over his shoulder at the swimming hole and its occupants. To her surprise, it was three of her students.  </p><p>Despite not wearing a thread between them, Scootaloo, Sweetie and Apple Bloom’s personalities shone through. The tanned farm girl and wiry tomboy were dripping wet and had the slightly chubby form of their curly-haired friend dangling from her wrists and ankles between them. Sweetie was writhing in mock protest as the two marched her to the pond. </p><p>“Girls! Stoooop!” Sweetiee pleaded. </p><p>Apple Bloom shook her head, “Enope! Ya shoved us in, Sweetie. Fair is fair.”</p><p>“Ready AB?” Scootaloo grunted as they splashed into the water’s edge. “Her big, fat marshmallow ass sure is heavy.”</p><p>The pale skinned girl glared at her friend and blushed, “It’s not… <b>THAT</b> big!”</p><p>“A’right, toss her in!”</p><p>With twin grunts of effort, Apple Bloom and Scootaloo dumped Sweetie into the pond. Her squeals of dismay were cut off when she belly-flopped into the water, producing a spectacular splash. Within a few moments, she broke the surface and launched herself at her friends, dragging them both in together with surprising strength. </p><p>Cheerliee backed away playing with her hair, “On second thought, I can just shower at home…”</p><p>Mac grabbed her arm gently, “Hold on now Mae, what’s wrong?”</p><p>“They’re my students! I can’t be seen naked around them, much less while they’re naked! If the school found out I could lose-” </p><p>“Eh now, hush,” The farmer replied, drawing her into an embrace. “Ah told you, yer body ain’t nothin’ ta be ashamed of. You ain’t planning on taking advantage of them, are ya?”</p><p>The teacher felt her nostril’s flare as she hissed, “Of course not!”</p><p>“Then why worry? The three of ‘em are good friends. Hell, better than I thought if they’re this comfortable already,” He smiled. “This is what naturism is all about. Bein’ yerrself ‘round others. Yer still their teacher but also a beautiful woman I’m honoured ta call mah girlfriend.” </p><p>Mae’s cheeks flushed as she played with her hair, “When you put it like that.” She sucked in a deep breath. “Right. Time to put your big girl pants on Daisy Mae!” Mac had the decency to stifle his snicker as she marched past him. “Let's go!”</p><p>Despite her heart thundering inside her chest, Mae emerged from the treeline with her head held high. Mac walked beside her, gripping her hand firmly, anchoring her. As they approached the pond, Scootaloo managed to break from the scrum and stagger onto the bank.</p><p>“Ha! Escaped ya!” She crowed, pushing her sodden bangs from her eyes. Catching sight of her teacher she gasped. “Wait a second. Is that you, Miss Cheerliee?!”</p><p>“Hello, Scootaloo. You look well today,” Mae replied with a nervous wave. </p><p>Scootaloo rubbed the back of her head, “Thanks. And you look--uh--cute, I think?” </p><p>Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle waded to the shore, so that they could stand on either side of Scootaloo and stare at their teacher. The farm girl had a delighted grin on her face and clapped her hands together. Sweetie, meanwhile, paused for a moment, unsure how to greet her. </p><p>“Oh mah gosh, Mac ya did it!” Apple Bloom gushed. “How are ya likin’ yer venture here at Sweet Apple Acres, Miss Cheerilee?”</p><p>Mae’s heart calmed slightly, “It’s beautiful, Apple Bloom. Your brother is a great tour guide.”</p><p>Sweetie rubbed her hands together and decided that an honest compliment would help clear up the awkward atmosphere. “You look so pretty, Miss Cheerilee. You fit Big Mac like a glove!” She blushed. “I-I mean, not <b>LITERALLY</b>! I’m not implying you two are-”</p><p>Placing her finger on her student’s mouth, Mae smiled kindly, “I know what you meant, Sweetie.” She took a deep breath and stepped back, looping her arm inside Mac’s. “Yes, we’re officially dating now but I’m sure you girls already knew that.”</p><p>Scootaloo smirked, “Gee, teach, what could ever have given it away? You giggling when you texted him in class or that blush on your- Ow! Bloom!”</p><p>As the tomboy rubbed her aching forehead, Apple Bloom placed her hands on her hips, “Watch yer tone Scoots! Miss Cheerilee’s still our teacher and deserves our respect.” </p><p>“Geeze…”</p><p>“Actually, since we’re outside of the classroom, you can just call me Daisy Mae,” Mae interjected with a smile. “Being out here with all of you… <i>like this</i>, it seems a bit silly to insist on titles.”</p><p>“Sure thing Ms- I mean Daisy Mae!” Sweetiee beamed. “Want to go swimming with us?”</p><p>“I’d love to, so long as you promise not to shove me in!” The smile her student gave her was sugar sweet. Too sweet, Mae realized. “You… won’t shove me in, right?”</p><p>Mac chuckled as he bent down to remove his boots, “Only one way ta find out, Ah reckon.” </p><hr/><p>Granny Smith chuckled to herself as she watched Sweetie Belle drag her teacher into the pond. As the shapely young woman disappeared below the water, Mac dunked Apple Bloom and Scootaloo in with a laugh and before long the pond dissolved into a full on splash fight. Reclining back in her chair, Granny took a long sip from her silver whiskey flask and ruffled Winona’s fur, who happened to be laying down next to the folding chair.  </p><p>“Ta be young again. These old bones ain’t what they used ta be.” </p><p>Winona barked in agreement as the Apple Matriarch scratched her behind the ears. She and Granny had parked themselves atop the hill overlooking the pond to play lifeguard. Watching the collie’s eagerly wagging tail Granny asked, “Ya want ta join ‘em, huh?”</p><p>The lolling tongue and happy whuff were answers enough. After patting the dog’s head, Granny ordered, “Go on an’ git.” Yipping at the top of her lungs, Winona took off like a greyhound and raced down the hill towards the pond. With a flying leap she barreled into Apple Bloom, knocking her deeper into the water. </p><p>Granny Smith picked up her smartphone and opened up her reading app. Most people thought that old folks were technologically inept. While Granny knew she was getting up there, she always figured that you were never too old to learn new things. These newfangled smartphones were a camera, phone, book, jukebox and more all in one. How could she not own one?</p><p>For the next several minutes, beyond occasionally glancing up to check on her grandchildren and their friends, Granny Smith continued reading <i>The</i> <i>Killer Angels. </i>When she’d first gotten her own <i>Bramble </i>account she’d been amazed at the number of e-books she’d had at her fingertips. As she completed yet another chapter, her phone shook in her hand. Glancing at the caller ID a smile spread across her wrinkled face like the rising sun. </p><p>Answering the video call, Granny waved with her free hand and said, “Johnny! How’s mah favourite grand nephew?”</p><p>The young man whose face appeared on the screen smiled wryly, “I’m alright, Auntie Smith.”</p><p>Johnny Apple-Seed was Granny Smith’s great grand-nephew and slightly older than Applejack. A slight young man by the standards of the Apples, his body was wiry and lean with sharp facial features. His wavy red hair was tied back in a short ponytail to better show off his emerald green eyes and the sea of freckles that surrounded them. He was wearing a plain blue hoodie and seemed to be sitting in a car. </p><p>“Johnny, ya best not be facetimin’ and drivin’,” Granny growled, narrowing her eyes.    </p><p>“Relax, auntie, I’m parked.” Johnny replied with a half hearted laugh.</p><p>“Ya better be. Don’t think Ah can’t still whoop yer pale backside if ya lie tah me. How’s the family Johnny? Is Babs still havin’ trouble adjustin’ ta the academy?”</p><p>The young man’s face fell. Granny leaned forward with concern, “What happened?” </p><p>“Our parents… they split up. It’s over. For good, this time.” Johnny sighed, rubbing his face. “I can’t say I’m surprised but... fuck it’s a mess.” He coughed. “Mom ran off with that sleazy meth-dealing boyfriend of hers and dad threw himself into work, like he always does.”</p><p>Granny bit her lip, brows furrowing. Her brother’s son, Kingston Apple, was a construction foreman by trade and damn good at his job. Unfortunately, he was so focused on his career that his skills as a father had left much to be desired. His wife, Rya Seed had been and remained a free spirit, unsuited to perform the domestic responsibilities Kingston had expected of her when they wed. They’d almost divorced when Johnny was around ten years old, but had stayed together when Rya gave birth to his little sister, Babs. </p><p>“Johnny, I’m sorry ta hear that,” though her words and demeanor were calm, inside, Granny’s rage seethed like a boiling kettle. “How are y’all holding up?”</p><p>“Fine, I guess,” He let out a heavy sigh and rubbed his eyes. “I’ve always known that their marriage would fall apart eventually, but I hoped it would work at least until Babs graduated.” </p><p>Granny Smith cocked her head, “And how is she?”</p><p>“Terrible. She’s one failed test away from getting expelled and refuses to wear anything around the house,” Johnny’s face twisted. “Mom tolerated it for a while but dad… he doesn’t want that type of ‘<i>hippie nonsense</i>’ under his roof.” </p><p>“Bastard,” Granny cursed under her breath.  </p><p>The young man swallowed nervously, “Auntie, could you take Babs in? I’m worried she’ll end up running away at this rate. She needs people who love her and support her, beyond me.” He blushed. “Would you mind terribly if I came too? I need to get away from this shithole city.” </p><p>“Yer parents don’t mind?”</p><p>“I don’t believe so. Dad knows he can’t give her the attention she needs and mom… well she lost her vote when she ran off with a drug peddler,” He shrugged helplessly. “I know it’s a lot to ask but I don’t know what else to do.”</p><p>“Y’all are family, boy. Course we’ll take ya in,” Granny Smith replied. “First though, ah gotta ask Mac, AJ and Bloom. Before long this place will be passed on to ‘em. They ought ta have a say.” </p><p>Johnny rubbed some tears from his eyes, “Don’t talk like that auntie, you’ll outlive us all! Thank you. Really.”</p><p>“Ah’ll call you when Ah talk ta them, Johnny. You keep yer sister safe now, ya hear?”</p><p>“Yes ma’am.”</p><p>When the video call finally ended, Granny leaned back in her chair and watched as Mac towed Cheerilee and her three students through the water. AJ was supposed to come back from her trip tomorrow. She’d break the news, good and bad, to everyone then.</p>
