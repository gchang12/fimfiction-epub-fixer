		<h1>An Exciting Afternoon At The Acres</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 17</b></p><p>Sweet Apple Acres, Ponyville </p><p>Johnny watched as the rest of his kin drove down the winding dirt road towards Ponyville, so that they could attend Applejack’s body paint exposition. He’d elected to stay behind, if for no other reason than the lingering awkwardness that still existed between himself and his younger cousin. Even though he’d slowly grown accustomed to all the casual nudity on display around the farm, Johnny also wanted some quiet time to himself. To think, relax, and reflect.  </p><p>An errant thought popped into his mind. He’d promised Roz a follow up date. If he invited her over now, they would have the entire farm to themselves for at least a few hours. After gathering up the courage to tap Roz’s contact icon on his phone, Johnny slowly typed out a brief, but meaningful text to her. For what seemed like an eternity, his finger hovered over the send button. He hesitated to tap it. Then it was done. He couldn’t take the invitation back now if he wanted to. </p><p>Almost instantly, a reply came back. Judging by all the emojis, Johnny assumed Roz was very much interested in the idea of a second date at Sweet Apple Acres. She assured him that Boris would not take very long to get her there, an hour at most. Upon slipping his phone into his pocket, the red-haired brewer blew out a short raspberry through his lips and went back inside the house from the front porch. Sensing the tension, Winona nuzzled her snout against his leg.</p><p>Johnny knelt down on one knee and ruffled her ears. “Is it obvious that I’m nervous?” </p><p>The border collie looked up at him expectantly and wagged her tail. </p><p>“I guess it is getting close to lunchtime. C’mon, girl. Let’s find something to eat.” </p><p>After eating a simple lunch, consisting of a chicken salad sandwich, potato chips, and iced tea, Johnny made his way upstairs once more. Winona followed close behind, making sure that her new charge was properly looked after. It was her duty to protect every member of the Apple Family, no matter their size, shape or scent. Johnny plopped onto his bed and checked his phone for a second. Still no word from Roz that she had arrived yet. </p><p>“Do you think I should take my clothes off for our date, Winona?” </p><p>Oblivious to her master’s dilemma, Winona began chewing on her favorite rope toy. </p><p>“I should start getting used to the idea of being naked around her at some point. It’ll be awkward as hell greeting her at the gate wearing nothing but a smile. Not to mention shrinkage. Then again, maybe not? S’not like I’ll be jumping into the pond first…” </p><p>Winona growled playfully while Johnny initiated a game of tug o’ war with her. </p><p>“Alright. It’s decided then. I’ll do it. I hope Roz isn’t as aggressive about escalating our relationship to the next level this time. That woman seriously needs to learn that people have boundaries. But she did seem sorry about what happened. I’ll give her a second chance.” </p><p>Johnny’s phone buzzed, signaling a text from his Russian girlfriend. Roz indicated that she would arrive within the next ten minutes. Within a few moments, Johnny took all of his clothes off and folded them into a neat pile, seeing no sense in dawdling about, lest he lose his nerve altogether. An overwhelming sense of wrongness filled the pit of his stomach with dread as he walked outside and towards the entrance of the farm. Never before had he felt so… exposed. </p><p>Winona cantered along cheerfully. As far as she was concerned, being outside with any of her human family members was always cause for excitement.  </p><p>Johnny sighed to himself. “At least it’s pleasantly warm here in Ponyville. Heh. Definitely not like Manehattan. Even during the summer. I can see why this would be preferable to wearing flannel work clothes and jeans while you’re out in the field all day bustin’ yer ass.” </p><p>Like a greased hog, Winona bolted towards the gate, barking excitedly at the woman who got out of her black sedan. Roz laughed while the collie licked her hand. In the crook of her arm, she held a medium-sized gift bag. As to what was contained within, only she knew. Fighting the overwhelming urge to cup his hands over his privates, Johnny smiled and waved to Roz. </p><p>Completely taken aback by her boyfriend’s nudity, Roz’s eyes widened in surprise. “Good afternoon, Johnny! It would appear that I am the one overdressed for the occasion today.” </p><p>While scrunching his toes in the grass, Johnny let out an awkward cough. “Yeah… I-I figured it was only fair since I’ve seen you naked on a few occasions already. Would you—um—like to come with me back to the house for some coffee or whatever?” </p><p>Smiling ear to ear, Roz took his outstretched hand. “Why, I’d love to! Then I can finally change into something… <i>more comfortable</i>~ You are welcome to join us, Winona!” </p><p>And so, the trio made their way back to the Apple Family homestead. No sooner had Roz put down her gift bag, did she start kicking off her sneakers and stripped out of her frilly black dress. She hadn’t bothered to wear any undergarments, which made Johnny blush a little when her breasts jiggled in response to all the movement. The couple stood opposite of each other, silent save for the chirping of insects and birdsong, yet their wandering eyes spoke volumes.  </p><p>Face flushed and heart pounding like a jackhammer, Johnny tried desperately to maintain his composure around Roz. He didn’t want to give his girlfriend the wrong impression. To her credit, the bubbly Russian baker hadn’t tried to tease him in an overt manner and maintained a polite distance. However, the hungry look in her eyes told him exactly what she was thinking. </p><p>Upon brewing a pot of coffee, Johnny took a seat on the couch out in the living room, subconsciously crossing his legs as he was not yet comfortable with “<i>letting it all hang out</i>”. Roz sat right next to him and with an eager expression and presented the garishly colored polka dot gift bag to him. Winona decided to join in on the action and curled up in a ball near Johnny’s feet, yawning after she did so. With an awkward chuckle, he began to open his gift. </p><p>Inside was a pair of what appeared to be cupcakes and… a plush rabbit? Utterly baffled, Johnny didn’t say anything for a good thirty seconds, which made Roz worry that she’d made a mistake. Seeing Roz’s forlorn expression broke Johnny from his reverie and he took it upon himself to grab one of the cupcakes. By the looks of it, the confection was covered in walnuts and cream cheese frosting. Knowing just how good her baking skills were, he didn’t doubt for a second that it would be delicious. And so, he took a large bite, realizing that it was carrot cake flavored. </p><p>“Wow! This is really good, Roz. Did you make them yourself?” </p><p>The dark-haired woman nodded. “<i>Da</i>. This morning, in fact. I wasn’t sure if you liked carrot cake or not… but I wanted to make you something that wasn’t apple related since we had <i>Sharlotka</i> on our last date. Not that there's anything wrong with apples, of course!”</p><p>Johnny chuckled. “True. So—uh—do you want the other one? I don’t mind sharing.” </p><p>Roz waved her hand dismissively. “There are ten more leftover back at my apartment. I was planning on giving Boris a few to share with his family and perhaps eat one for myself.” </p><p>“Oh. Alright then. I’ll save the other one for later.” Johnny went into the kitchen to fetch a napkin and when his hands were clean, he held up the plush rabbit.</p><p>The odd thing about the stuffed animal was how realistic it looked. The toy bunny had a tawny brown coat like most wild rabbits possessed. That’s not to say it wasn’t adorable. Even so, Johnny had a difficult time understanding why Roz would buy him a plushie in the first place. It wasn’t as though he had a particular fondness for them. </p><p>“Do you like your other present, Johnny?” Roz asked with some hesitation in her voice. </p><p>Struggling to find the right words, Johnny bit his lip. “Well, it is cute… I suppose.” </p><p>Rubbing her thighs together nervously, Roz frowned. “I messed up, didn’t I?” </p><p>Johnny shook his head emphatically. “No! Absolutely not! I like my gift, but I’m just… a little confused as to why you would buy me a stuffed animal of all things. I—erm—don’t recall ever mentioning I collected them or anything. Please don’t get upset, Roz. Look, I’m not very good at these sorts of conversations. I’ll just… shut up before I dig my hole <b>EVEN</b> deeper.” </p><p>Cheeks rosy red, Roz twiddled her fingers. “I collect stuffed animals of all varieties, so I thought that you might want to have one too. He’s very soft and fun to cuddle. I promise!” </p><p>“Careful. You might make Winona jealous.” </p><p>Upon hearing her name mentioned, the collie’s ears perked up and she barked. </p><p>Roz responded by stroking Winona’s fur with her toes, reveling in the softness of the canine’s coat. “I believe she will be fine. Truth be told, I did not think very far ahead as to what we would be doing together on our second date. I was so excited to see you that my only concern was arriving here as quickly as possible. I hope that is not an issue…” </p><p>Johnny rubbed the back of his neck. “Uh—really? Funny thing is: I wasn’t too sure either.” </p><p>Roz giggled. “Then we are like two peas in a pod! That is the correct English idiom, yes?”</p><p>“Mhmm. I’d say so,” Johnny agreed, “I was thinking. Since it’s so nice outside, maybe we could walk around the farm and enjoy the scenery. We could always go for a swim in the pond too.” </p><p>Roz tapped her chin in thought. “I don't feel like swimming today.”</p><p>“Oh. How about the walk? Or is that a no-go?”</p><p>Roz placed her hand on Johnny’s thigh. “As long as I get to spend time with you, it will be fine.” </p><p>“How about yoga? I was curious about it, and you seem to know what you’re doing.” </p><p>Roz pumped her fist into the air. “That’s a wonderful idea! Not to worry; Johnny. We don’t need to use fancy foam yoga mats, but I would suggest bringing along a couple of blankets for our practice session. Otherwise, bits of grass will stick to the most unpleasant places imaginable!”</p><p>Johnny chuckled. “Speaking from personal experience?” </p><p>“<i>Da</i>. It is not a mistake I intend to repeat.” </p><p>“Fair enough. Lemme look around and see if I can find any blankets.”</p><p>While Roz busied herself by pampering Winona with tummy rubs, Johnny went upstairs to try and find a pair of blankets, or anything that could serve as an impromptu yoga mat. The brewer let out a frustrated growl when he rummaged through the hall closet next to the bathroom. There were plenty of towels, but no sign of a blanket anywhere. By pure dumb luck, he scampered over to his room, and found a stack of two, red &amp; black plaid blankets, folded neatly in the back of the closet where he hung all of his dress shirts on hangers along the rack above.  </p><p>Upon bundling them in the crook of his arm, Johnny scrunched his nose in annoyance. The fabric was heavy, coarse and itchy, indicating that they hadn’t been laundered in quite some time. However, they would just have to make do. He promptly stuffed them into a gym bag along with a couple of water bottles in case they got thirsty. It was important to keep hydrated, after all.  </p><p>By the time Johnny ambled down the stairs towards the living room, Winona was sound asleep, snoring softly, in a ball curled up on the floor. Roz got up from the couch as carefully and quietly as she could, so as not to wake the slumbering canine. Luckily for them both, they managed not to step on any of the squeaky wooden floorboards as they exited the farmhouse and made their way towards the southern orchard right past the family swimming hole. </p><p>There was nary a cloud in the sky as the mid-afternoon sun shone down upon the acres, embracing their naked bodies in its welcoming warmth. Johnny allowed himself a satisfied grin. Roz eagerly took a hold of his arm while they walked together, barefoot, through the grassy terrain. The pillowy softness of her breast pressed up against his side, which he was certain Roz had to be aware of but declined to say anything about it. He enjoyed the sensation too much. </p><p>Eventually, the young couple reached a massive black oak the Apple Family referred to as “<i>Old Sampson</i>”. Given its size and the girth of its trunk, Johnny estimated that the tree must have been at least a century old, if not older. Possibly pre-dating the founding of Sweet Apple Acres. He ran his fingers along its gnarled bark and whistled. Roz was quick to follow suit. </p><p>“I have never seen such a big tree before! How old do you think it is?” She asked. </p><p>“Honestly, I have no idea. Granny Smith might know. Maybe we can ask her later.” </p><p>Roz grabbed one of the blankets from the gym bag and started flapping it in the air before she set it down gently atop the grass. “Truth be told, I am accustomed to having more padding than this, but it’s not as though we’re going to be sitting down on the hard ground directly. Make yourself comfortable, Johnny. We shall begin our warm-up session soon.” </p><p>Johnny did so, feeling somewhat awkward as he sat cross-legged. His hunch about the blanket being rough against his bare skin held true. He shifted his position a few times to try and get more comfortable, but it was ultimately a lost cause. He hoped that most of the yoga positions Roz had in mind would be done standing rather than sitting or lying down. Johnny did not want to have an itchy rash in places that rarely saw the light of day. In a surprising display of spryness, Roz bounced to her feet in an instant and began rolling her head from side to side. </p><p>“First thing’s first. We must loosen up our muscles. Follow my lead!” </p><p>Most of the stretches were pretty standard. In fact, they reminded Johnny of his high school days during gym class. Unlike high school, however, he’d never had the pleasure of standing behind a curvaceous, Russian nudist before. When Roz bent down to touch her toes, Johnny got an eyeful of her pale rump and a tiny sliver of salmon pink peeking through the gap in-between her legs. </p><p>Flustered, Johnny closed his eyes, counted to ten, and let out a ragged sigh. Roz looked back; her eyes filled with concern. “Are you alright, Jonny? Straining a muscle is no laughing matter.” </p><p>Johnny cracked open his eyes and glanced downward, relieved that he’d somehow managed to remain flaccid. “Yeah. I-I’m fine. Blood rushed to my head for a second. We can keep going.”</p><p>Unaware that he’d meant his <i>lower head</i>; Roz took Johnny at his word and finished the remainder of her stretches with ease. Afterwards, she shouted something in Russian that sounded an awful lot like a war cry and her baby blue eyes lit up with excitement. Try as he might, Johnny was not operating at the same level, and gave his girlfriend a half-hearted “<i>yahoo</i>” in response. After a quick swig of water, Roz placed her hands on her hips and grinned. </p><p>“Since you are a mere beginner, we shall be doing simple poses today. Nothing too strenuous, I assure you. To start off, let’s spread our legs apart and assume the Warrior pose! Remember to lift your arms above your head and press your hands together like a triangle.” </p><p>This time around, Roz was face to face with her boyfriend, so that she could demonstrate the technique and ensure he was doing it properly. Unlike the last time she’d practiced yoga in her apartment, Johnny could tell that she was focused purely on the physical aspects of the position, rather than exposing her body with lascivious intent. It went a long way towards helping Johnny feel more at ease around Roz, despite not having grown accustomed to seeing her naked yet.</p><p>Just as Johnny was starting to enjoy the benefits of a brisk yoga session, Roz adopted an entirely different pose from before. She laid flat on her back, legs pointed upward in a U-formation, whilst taking hold of the arches of her feet. With childlike innocence, she rocked her hips, moving side to side, commenting on how good it felt to stretch out all of the muscles in her legs. </p><p>Still standing a few paces away in the grass, Johnny watched her display of flexibility with rapt attention. This time around, his baser instincts got the better of him and he was unable to resist gawking at Roz’s unmentionables, completely exposed and inviting him to dig in. While his member became harder with each passing moment, he struggled to maintain his composure. </p><p>Roz stopped rocking her hips; eyes transfixed by her boyfriend’s impressive erection. She’d spent a lot of time fantasizing what it would look like and she was not disappointed. Like Macintosh, his penis was quite thick around already, even more so at full mast. Yet, his was not nearly as long. A little bit above average size, by Roz’s estimation. She licked her lips and giggled to herself, noticing how his foreskin still covered the head, leaving only the tip exposed. </p><p>“<i>Bozhe moy</i>! You appear to be <b>VERY</b> excited right now, Johnny.” </p><p>Johnny covered up his privates instinctively, his cheeks flushed pink while he clenched his toes in the grass. “Aw fuck! I’m sorry, Roz. Seeing you all exposed like this is—uh—very distracting for me. Just… give me a few minutes and maybe my hard-on will go away. Sorry.” </p><p>Roz sprang to her feet and approached Johnny carefully. She then cupped his cheeks and placed a gentle kiss upon his lips, smiling afterwards. “You have nothing to be sorry for, <i>milaya moya</i>. I must confess that I too have been thinking about doing naughty things with you. However, I didn’t want to upset you by being too forward. Like what happened on our last date…” </p><p>Johnny hesitantly moved his hands to his sides and sighed. “Yeah, I noticed. Roz, I really do appreciate what you did today. Honestly! Everything’s been moving so fast lately that I needed some time to sort out what direction I wanted to take my life. Now though, I think I’m ready to commit to our relationship one hundred percent. Meaning, I want to become intimate with you.” </p><p>Roz blushed, shuffling her feet while she twirled a strand of her jet-black hair. “This is certainly good news. But—um—there is something else I would like to get off of my chest, so to speak.” </p><p>“What’s wrong? You look upset.”</p><p>Roz shook her head. “I am not upset exactly. More like… embarrassed? Oh, Johnny! The problem is that I haven’t had sex with another man in what feels like forever! I fear that I am—what is the English phrase—a little rusty. I don’t want our first time to be boring or awkward.” </p><p>Johnny placed his hands on her shoulders, rubbing them gently as a gesture of comfort. “That’s ok. We’re in the same boat, Roz. I haven’t been in a relationship for years. Look—why don’t you lay down on the blanket and spread your legs for me. I want to make you feel good.” </p><p>“But you are so hard! Don’t you want me to take care of that first?”</p><p>Johnny chuckled. “Sure am. But I don’t mind waiting a bit. Relax. Let me take the lead instead.”</p><p>Roz began to cry and sniffed as she laid on her back, spreading her legs apart so that Johnny could access what lay between them. “Fret not, for these are tears of happiness! Shall we begin?”</p><p>Taking his cue, Johnny crawled onto his knees and used his fingers to spread apart Roz’s delicate, salmon pink folds. As he drew closer, he could smell a slight floral aroma, clear evidence that she dabbed a bit of perfume around her pubic hair. He began by running the tip of his tongue along the edges, causing Roz to let out a sound that was somewhere between a gasp, a giggle, and a snort. Whatever the noise was, she sounded cute doing it. Without hesitation, Johnny dove right in, plunging deeper into Roz until his tongue was fully immersed inside. </p><p>Using an old trick he’d learned from previous girlfriends, Johnny swirled his tongue in a circular motion, eliciting an immediate reaction from his curvy Russian lover. Roz gripped the edges of the blanket and curled her toes as an electric wave of pleasure radiated from stomach outward, making her feel like a quivering pile of jelly. Johnny continued, utterly relentless in his quest to pleasure Roz, teasing the stud piercing with his finger at the same time. Roz arched her back, letting out a throaty moan. Mere moments later, Johnny’s face was slick with her essence.  </p><p>Only then did he stop. Johnny laughed when he saw his lover panting heavily, skin flushed. “I have not… cum that hard… in… a very long time. Sorry if I made a mess on your face.” </p><p>“No worries. You taste pretty good, Roz.” </p><p>“What exactly do I taste like?” She asked with some hesitation. </p><p>Johnny tapped his chin in thought. “S’not a particularly strong flavor. Neutral for the most part but there’s a hint of sweetness right at the end. By the way, I love the perfume you used.” </p><p>Roz smiled bashfully. “Good. I was hoping that you would like it. The scent is one of my favorites. An import from my homeland. A combination of lavender and rose oil.” </p><p>Before he could ask her what brand of perfume it was, Johnny’s heart began to race when Roz giggled, then braced herself against <i>Old Sampson</i>. With a sultry wink, she wiggled her plump pale rump enticingly. At a loss for words, the young brewer chose to admire his lover’s curves in silence. “I have been waiting a very long time for this moment, Johnny. You know how much I want you right now. Just imagine how easily you could slip inside of me. I won’t resist~” </p><p>Johnny waddled forward, grabbing hold of his shaft so that he could line it up with Roz’s glistening lips. He tried his best to be a gentleman and insert himself a little bit at a time. However, Roz was so slick from her previous orgasm that he ended up bottoming out after pressing his hips against her backside with the slightest amount of pressure. Had they not been alone together, outside, Johnny would have been mortified by the guttural moan that came out of Roz’s mouth. He paused for a moment, trying to get more comfortable. </p><p>“Are you ok?”</p><p>Roz panted. “<i>Da</i>. I am fine. It’s just that… I was not expecting to be stuffed so quickly!” </p><p>“May I start moving?” Johnny asked.</p><p>“You may. <i>Bozhe moy</i>! Your penis is so thick! Much more so than I realized…”</p><p>Johnny chose to ignore her embarrassing comment about his equipment. Even though, he supposed, it was a compliment of sorts. As expected, when he began to fuck Roz in earnest, her inner walls coiled around him like a warm, slippery vice grip. Johnny had to pause a few times and pace himself, lest he cum too quickly before Roz had a chance to enjoy another orgasm. Judging by her near constant mewls and moans, Johnny decided that she would be satisfied no matter how long he took to release his load. While the wet smacking sounds of flesh meeting flesh, pervaded the air, Roz managed to collect her thoughts enough for a single comment.</p><p>“Nghh! Don’t… worry… about pulling out. Fill me with your baby batter, Johnny!” </p><p>Johnny clenched his butt cheeks together and pushed forward as far as he could go, letting out a primal grunt of pure, unadulterated pleasure. All of the sexual tension that had been building up since he’d met Roz was released all at once while he pumped her full of his milky white seed. She screamed in response, coating his legs and the blanket below in a shower of her own cum. Sweaty and panting, Roz’s grip on the tree loosened and she collapsed onto the ground. Johnny soon followed, cuddling up next to her while they watched the clouds float by. </p><p>Roz leaned over and kissed his cheek. “Thank you, <i>moya lyubov</i>. That was wonderful.” </p><p>“Whew. I haven’t cum that hard since… damn. I can’t even remember.” </p><p>Roz ran her hand over his pecs. “What’s important is that we can do so again. Many more times in the near future, I hope. Sexual compatibility is a big part of lasting relationships, no?” </p><p>“Maybe. I’m not what you’d call an expert on the subject.” Johnny replied honestly. </p><p>“Neither am I. However, I am confident that we can make this work.” </p><p>Johnny slowly rose to his feet, peed in a patch of grass by the tree, and let out a sigh of relief while he flushed out the leftover cum from their love-making session. Roz squatted beside him and did the same. Her complete lack of hesitation made him laugh. Only after he finished his business, did Johnny realize that the blanket they’d used was soaked in all sorts of unsavory fluids and would need to be laundered immediately. Not to mention, they reeked of sweat &amp; sex and would need to take a shower before the rest of the Apple family arrived home. </p><p>Hand in hand, the young couple took their time walking back to the farmhouse, content to enjoy the weather and presence of good company. Roz began to share more details regarding her personal life, like what kind of music she enjoyed listening to, her favorite places to shop, and the topic of food inevitably popped up again. Johnny felt more comfortable around her than before, but he still wasn’t quite ready to open himself up to her fully. At least, not yet. Trust took time to build even when there was a solid foundation to begin with. </p><p>When they opened the door, a single bark heralded the arrival of Winona, along with the skittering sound of her paws against the wooden floor boards. She approached Roz and Johnny more cautiously than before, sniffing the air a few times and whuffing. Even though she was a dog, Johnny realized that Winona could smell what they’d done and blushed accordingly. He crouched on his haunches and ruffled the dog’s fur offering her a sincere apology. </p><p>“Don’t worry, girl. We’re going to take a shower soon enough. Uh… tell ya what. If you keep this a secret between us, I’ll share some of my Cajun beef jerky with you. How’s that sound?”</p><p>Winona barked in response and began wagging her tail. </p><p>Roz leaned over and whispered in Johnny’s ear. “Winona is quite the clever puppy-dog. Do you think we should be more careful about fucking in your room whenever she is around? Even though I have been a nudist my entire life, I am not keen on the idea of being barged in upon by curious family members. Furry or otherwise, if you catch my meaning.”</p><p>Johnny chuckled while rubbing the back of his neck. “Today was an exception to the rule, rather than the norm. We should probably—erm—engage in those sorts of activities elsewhere. There's too many people living here to get any semblance of privacy. Plus, the walls are pretty damn thin. As for Winona, she knows where her bread is buttered. We should be fine.” </p><p>Roz sauntered up the stairway with a wicked grin. “Assuming that we focus on getting clean~”</p><p>Johnny felt his penis stir to life once again at the sight of his girlfriend’s jiggling rump but chose to push his baser instincts aside. He joined Roz in the upstairs bathroom a few moments later. “No funny business in the shower. We’re only doing this to freshen up. I mean it, Roz!”</p><p>Roz crossed her arms underneath her breasts and pouted. “Boo! You’re no fun, Johnny!”</p><p>“We can snuggle in my bed afterwards, ok?” The young man suggested. </p><p>Roz appeared to consider his offer, tapping her foot against the tiled floor. “Very well. I agree to your conditions. BUT! You must let me stay over for dinner tonight. Sex always makes me hungry. Even now, I can hear my tummy rumbling. Oh! Do you think Applejack could rustle up some fried chicken? And those biscuits with the sawmill gravy are to <b>DIE FOR</b>!!!” </p><p>“Honestly, I have no clue what’s in the pantry. I’d have to take a look.” </p><p>Roz smiled sheepishly. “I keep forgetting that you are not culinarily inclined. No matter! I’m certain that your family keeps plenty of tasty food around. Even if it is not fried chicken and biscuits. What about apple fritters? Surely, there are enough apples around to make a batch.” </p><p>Johnny sighed after turning the hot water knob. “Shower first, food later.”   </p><p>True to her word, Roz behaved herself during their shared bathing experience. Afterwards, the couple decided to snuggle in Johnny’s bed until supper time like he had promised earlier. Without a shred of hesitation, Roz latched onto her boyfriend like an oversized teddy bear, nuzzling him and whispering sweet nothings in her native tongue. Johnny had no idea what a word of it meant, but he could tell Roz was happy and that was all that mattered in the end. </p><p>Only a short time passed before Roz’s soft snores echoed throughout the room. Yet, Johnny remained awake, staring vacantly at the clock radio sitting atop his dresser. The Manehattanite reflected on the events of their second date, and everything else that had happened beforehand. For the first time in years, he felt… content. Dare he say: true happiness? A sense of purpose? </p><p>All the defenses Johnny had built up to help shield himself and Babs from the harsh realities of their previous life, lowered, if by just a tiny bit while wrapped in Roz’s embrace. It would still take a while to wrestle his demons and finally put them to rest, Johnny mused, but eventually, he could see himself calling Ponyville home. A real home. Not some ramshackle apartment downtown that he was forced to dwell in due to circumstances beyond his control. </p><p>“Yeah,” Johnny muttered after a yawn, “Ponyville ain’t so bad after all.”</p>
