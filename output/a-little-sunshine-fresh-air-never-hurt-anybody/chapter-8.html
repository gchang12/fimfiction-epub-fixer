		<h1>The Tasty Treat And Teenage Turmoil</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 8</b></p><p>Sweet Apple Acres, Ponyville<b> </b></p><p>Big Mac grunted as he hefted the two casks of whiskey onto his broad shoulders. Striding along with practised ease, he walked through the cellar and ascended the stairs two at a time, a thin film of sweat developing on his brow. Walking out into the brewery proper, the big naturist strode towards the doors and nudged them open with his foot.</p><p>The cool breeze of Sweet Apple Acres chased the sweat away as he made his way towards the idling delivery truck parked in the driveway. The logo on the side of the truck was that of a cartoonish, smiling elephant in a kaleidoscope of colors with the words <i>The Tasty Treat </i>printed below it. The Tasty Treat was one of the premier Indian restaurants in the area and had been doing business for the Apples for many years.</p><p>As Mac approached the truck, it’s owner emerged from the back pushing a metal dolly in front of him. Standing in the fresh air, he removed a handkerchief from his pocket and daubed his sweaty forehead. At the sight of Mac he did his usual double take and waved cheerfully.</p><p>Coriander Cumin was a portly, dark-skinned man who served as the manager and host of his family restaurant. Coriander had thick black hair carefully combed and gelled back with a thick moustache to match. His face was round and jovial while he was clad in a pair of sandals, loose brown pants and a silk orange dress shirt unbuttoned to his chest, letting his curly chest hair poke out.</p><p>“Macintosh, my friend, is that everything?” He called out in heavily-accented English as he wandered down the ramp. He whistled as Mac plodded up to him. “I see why you have all those muscles, young man! You’re practically a human ox.”</p><p>Mac smirked as he halted in front of the shorter man, “Does that make me an icon or somethin’?”</p><p>Coriander’s laughter was hearty, “Sweet Vishnu, no! You may be blessed with a body befitting a god and the modesty of yogi, but you are no sacred cow.” Shaking his head he helped Mac ease the two barrels from his shoulders.</p><p>Rubbing them Mac asked, “Ya reckon this will do?”</p><p>Coriander grunted as he shifted one of the barrels onto his dolly, “Do? You mean will this free barrel of your excellent whiskey get you a reservation at my place?”</p><p>“Eeyep?” Mac asked, shuffling his feet. The older man shot him a serious look and nodded at the other barrel. After letting out a brief grunt, he picked the cask up for Coriander and placed it carefully atop the other.</p><p>Taking the dolly Coriander grunted and shifted it onto its wheels. While the man may have looked like nothing more than a pudgy restaurant owner who liked his daughter’s cooking too much, wiry muscle lurked just beneath the flab.</p><p>Pushing his load up the ramp into his truck, he replied with a bright smile. “Of course it will! Come Macintosh, you hardly had to bribe me. How long have our families been doing business together?”</p><p>“Shucks, goin’ on a decade now. Twenty if ya count my pa’s time.”</p><p>“Which I do,” Coriander remarked as he and Mac loaded his ramp into the truck. “I have always found your lifestyle strange, but you Apples are good people. You know, Saffron recently asked me if you’d found yourself a wife yet.” He shot Mac a look with a twinkle in his eye. </p><p>“Well, Daisy-Mae and Ah haven’t seen each other fer many years but since we reconnected, we’ve really hit it off. I’m hopin’ that she’ll be open ta the idea o’ marriage one day… after a few dates, o’ course.”</p><p>Coriander slammed the truck bed shut and hopped down from it with a grunt, “Well, then it’s settled. You two shall have our finest booth this Friday!”</p><p>“Mr Cumin, come on now. Ya don’t need to give us yerr best seat…”</p><p>“Nonsense! You are a family friend and a reliable business partner. Besides, if our families’ relationship is to continue there will need to be another generation, no?”</p><p>Mac chuckled. “Reckon that’s one way o’ lookin’ at it.”</p><p>While Cumin walked towards the driver’s seat, he turned, “Did you find something to wear? I don’t need Saffron throwing herself at you as well.”</p><p>“I’m sure I’ll find something to wear, Coriander. You drive safe now, ya hear?”</p><p>“Give my salutations to your grandmother!” He called as he entered the truck and turned on the radio. Mac smirked as some classic Hindi Pop tunes began to blast from the truck’s open window as it pulled out of the driveway and down the road. Closing the gate behind him, Mac’s smile grew wider as he made his way back to the brewery.</p><p>The big man grabbed his smartphone from its place on a pallet of hard cider before locking up the building. As he walked towards the swimming hole for a refreshing dip, he opened up his text conversation with Daisy-Mae. Since their meeting at AB’s orientation, the two had been texting and chatting with one another constantly.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#BE7A43">Good news, Mae. I got us a reservation at The Tasty Treat for Friday evening. You free? </span>Mac texted with a smile.</p><p>Cresting the hill that led to the pond, he smiled at the sight of Apple Bloom doing a backstroke. The youngest sibling often enjoyed a good swim after school as a way to cool off. Mac waved to her as he descended the hill and his phone chimed with her response. Heart beating a little faster he opened it.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#AF2673">OMG! Really? I hear that place has a three week waiting list. How’d you pull that off?</span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#BE7A43">A man’s got to have his secrets. 😉 You free?</span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#AF2673">Am I ever! What should I wear?</span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#BE7A43">Something comfortable, I imagine. XD</span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#AF2673">For a special occasion like this? I’ll find something comfortable and cute! BRB</span></p><p>After placing his phone on a log, Mac waded into the pond. Unlike his sisters, Mac preferred a good wade and splash to any kind of actual swimming. As a result his method of submersion was simple. Spreading his arms out wide, Mac flopped into the pond sending up a wake that buffeted Apple Bloom in the face. </p><p>As Mac rose up, water trickling off his muscles like a Greek Hero, Apple Bloom was coughing and shot him a sour look. “Refreshed are ya?”</p><p>“Very,” Mac replied while playfully splashing his sister. </p><p>The redhead shirked and returned the favour. “Mr Cumin’s order go alright?”</p><p>“Mhmm. Got everything loaded up within an hour. Not too bad,” Mac replied, splashing some water on his chest.</p><p>“We don’t develop these muscles fer nothin’,” Bloom replied, flexing one arm as she tread water. “How about yer plans fer shackin’ up with mah social studies teacher?”</p><p>“Apple Bloom! Don’t say such things,” Mac admonished. “Mae and Ah ain’t a couple o’ frisky teenagers lookin’ fer a quick romp in the hay. We’re mature adults goin’ on a date.” Noting her barely hidden smirk and snicker, he rolled his eyes. “And yes, Ah got us a reservation. She sounded pretty excited about it.” </p><p>Apple Bloom winked at her brother. “Sweetie and Scoots certainly would be. Ah dunno how I’ll break it to them that ya might be off the market soon.” </p><p>The older Apple dunked his head underwater once more and slicked his hair back, “Say, speaking of which, how are y’all settling into junior high? Is it everythin’ ya hoped fer?”</p><p>“I’m doing alright, Ah suppose” Bloom replied, smile fading. “But I’ve noticed that there’s a bit o’ tension between Sweetie and Scoots lately. No idea what’s goin’ on.” </p><p>Mac scratched his chest, “Sounds like teenage drama ta me.” </p><p>“Ah hope not. We got a group project comin’ up fer Miss Cheerlie’s class. Maybe they’re just stressed out over the whole thing.” </p><p>The chime of a text message interrupted the two siblings. Smiling, Mac waded back to shore and shook himself off like a dog. His sister came behind him, hands digging into the pond bottom as she moved like a wily crocodile towards shore. Picking up his phone he read. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#AF2673">Are you still there? </span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#BE7A43">Yep. </span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#AF2673">Good. What do you think of this?</span></p><p>Seconds later, Mac’s mouth became dry and his heart raced when he received a selfie from Mae. The school teacher had clearly just stepped out of the shower, her mulberry locks wet and hanging across her bare chest. The shot was meant to show only a tantalizing hint of cleavage. While her face, even without makeup, was joyous and playful. Mae had one eye closed, the tip of her tongue stuck out, and two fingers were raised in the shape of a V.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#AF2673">How’s that for a bathing beauty? </span></p><p>Apple Bloom's chin resting on her brother's shoulder was the only thing that broke him out of his reverie. She whistled at the picture on his phone. “Dang. Miss Cheerliee sure is a looker, Mac. Ah reckon she's interested in takin' things ta the next level.”</p><p>“Eyep,” Mac beamed. “I reckon I oughta tell her so.”</p><p>Before he could begin texting a reply, Apple Bloom grabbed his arm, “Hold on just a second! Ya can’t just tell a gal she’s hot.” At his blank look on his face, she rolled her eyes. “Well, ya tell her she’s cute but send her a selfie back! She’s flirtin’ with ya.”</p><p>Mac blushed. “Ya know Ah don’t much care fer takin’ vanity photos o’ mahself.”</p><p>Bloom shrugged, “Well, ah suppose ya could always just send her a dick pic. Guys seem ta like doin’ that, fer some reason.” At his scandalized look, she threw up her hands. “Ah ain’t sayin’ ya should do it too. That’s just what’s popular these days!”</p><p>“So, do ya really think Ah should send her a selfie?”</p><p>“Yer wet, nekkid, good lookin’, and got a gorgeous backdrop,” Bloom remarked, gesturing to the pond and orchard behind them. “If not now, when?”</p><p>Swallowing visibly Mac toggled his camera, “Well… alright then. Should Ah strike a pose or…?” At her deadpan look Mac simply ran a hand through his hair and smiled bashfully, taking the photo so it showed off his pecs but not much else. He didn’t have any problem with Cheerliee seeing him in the nude. Far from it, in fact. But he didn’t want to give her the impression that he was some vainglorious jerk obsessed with sending out “<i>Dick Pics</i>” as Apple Bloom had so eloquently phrased it. </p><p>Sending the photo to Mae he texted a simple message. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#BE7A43">Can’t see how any dress in the world could possibly beat yer birthday suit. </span><img alt=":heart:" class="emoticon" src="https://static.fimfiction.net/images/emoticons/heart.png"/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#BE7A43"> </span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#AF2673">Well, look who’s talking~ Oh, my goodness! You could pose for an entire calendar shoot and not not a single page of it would bore me. Yum 😋</span></p><p>Mac blushed and felt a warmth kindle in his chest, grinning goofily he replied. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#BE7A43">Well thank you kindly. </span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#AF2673">No, thank you! Can’t wait for Friday now. </span></p><p>Neither could Big Mac. </p><hr/><p>Apple Bloom smiled as she entered her social studies class and spied Miss Cheerliee smiling widely as she checked her phone. Since her little nudge, it seemed like Mac was getting better at flirting. If her teacher’s reaction was anything to go by.</p><p>Apple Bloom settled into her seat between Sweetie and Scoots, then greeted the two warmly. “How’s it goin’, gals?”</p><p>“I’m alright,” Scootaloo remarked, yawning. “Coach Will put us through our paces in PE this morning.”</p><p>Sweetie wrinkled her nose. “I can tell. You smell like my dad’s old gym bag.”</p><p>Scootaloo lifted the collar of her shirt and sniffed herself with a slight blush. “Hey! I showered after class was over. Just because I used men’s body wash doesn’t mean--” </p><p>“Uh-huh. Say, what do you think has Ms Cheerliee tittering like Diamond Tiara getting a new dress?’ Sweetie asked. </p><p>Apple Bloom chuckled and rubbed her neck. “Ah reckon that’d be mah brother.” Both of her friends' heads whipped around to stare at her. “They’re seein’ each other. Well, beginnin’ ta, at least.” </p><p>Sweetie blew out her cheeks dramatically. “Seriously?!”</p><p>“A dude packing a magnum like that wouldn’t stay a bachelor for long.” Scoots replied, waggling her eyebrows. Before Apple Bloom could retort, Sweetie shot Scootaloo a glare. </p><p>“Ughh! Must you always be so crass, Scoots? Macintosh is a handsome, well-mannered gentleman. He’s not some slab of meat to slobber all over!”</p><p>“Oh yeah? Don’t act like you weren’t staring at his weiner too!”</p><p>“Whatever, Scootaloo.”</p><p>“Kiss my ass, Sweetie.” The tomboy replied while flipping her middle finger. </p><p>Before Apple Bloom could intervene, Ms Cheerliee called the class to order. When she began roll call, Apple Bloom studied her friends closely. Sweetie and Scoots always bickered but lately she’d noticed a greater amount of tension between the two than usual. The jabs were becoming more personal, and mean spirited. She stewed on this as Cheerliee booted up the projector.</p><p>“Today, we’re going to wrap up our unit on Ancient Greece.” Cheerliee beamed clicking through a series of images of Greek Ruins. “For those of you who were paying attention, we learned about the rise of Ancient Greece following the Bronze Age Collapse of Mycenaeans. We traced the evolution of the city states of Sparta and Athens and, of course, the birth of Western Philosophy and Democracy.”</p><p>She paused as her class shifted in their seats, Scoots poorly stifling a yawn, “However, the thing I find most interesting about Ancient Greece is its rich mythology.” The slides now showed a variety of images of Greek Gods and Monsters which perked the class up. “Especially the fact that, depending on the story, you could get two very different versions of the same character.”</p><p>The slide settled on a bust of a woman with snakes for hair, “Take Medusa, for example. A gorgon whose face was so terrible it turned men to stone. In early legends, she was one of three gorgon sisters slain by the hero Perseus but in other accounts, she was a beautiful woman cursed by the gods after Posiedon raped her.”</p><p>“That’s terrible,” Sweetie muttered. </p><p>Cheerliee smiled, “It is. However, thanks to recent archaeological work we’ve discovered a third version of her story.” The slides now showed a reconstructed vase that depicted a nude maiden flanked by a nude man holding aloft a sword. To either side of them was a woman with the lower body of a snake and a statuesque woman with golden, flowing locks. “The Tale of Aphrodite’s Daughter is a fascinating one. Not only is a woman the protagonist of the story, but Medusa is depicted as a jaded priestess keen on taking vengeance upon the goddess who scorned her. Yet, Medusa is no monster and instead an ally who helps Aphrodite’s daughter overcome…” </p><p>The teacher flipped to a blank side, “We don’t know the full story yet but that is the point of your group project. I want you, using what you’ve learned about Greek history, to write a reinterpretation of a classic Greek Myth. You can present it in written form, as a brief play or a visual medium of your choosing. Groups can be no more than four. If you have any questions, come ask me.” Clapping her hands together, Cheerliee beamed. “Well, my junior Muses? Get to work!”</p><p>Scoots clapped her hands, “Girls, this oughta be a home run! My parents are all about ancient stuff.”</p><p>Apple Bloom beamed, “It oughta be fun. What do ya think, Sweetie?”</p><p>“I think we need a fourth groupmate,” Sweetie muttered, rising up and waving. “Dinky! Over here!”</p><p>The cheerful blonde perked up and scrambled over to sit by them. Shorter then all three of them by about a foot with a petite build. She was wearing a pair of ragged jeans, a grey hoodie and sandals. </p><p>“Oh, wow! I’d love to. What’re we gonna write about?”</p><p>Scootaloo nudged Apple Bloom. “Why don’t we do a take on Atlantis where it’s one gigantic nudist colony?”</p><p>Apple Bloom rolled her eyes. “First of all, that term is a bit dated. Second of all, not everything in my life revolves around the fact that Ah happen ta enjoy bein’ nekkid.”</p><p>“Pfft! I was just messing with ya,” Scoots replied with a wave of her hand. “How about you, new girl? Any thoughts?”</p><p>Dinky rubbed her chin. “I’ve always loved reading about the Trojan War…”</p><p>The tomboy blanched. “That might be difficult to adapt, Dinky.” </p><p>“Afraid of a little commitment Scootaloo?” Sweetie casually asked.</p><p>Missing the quick exchange of glares her two friends shot one another, the farm girl rubbed her chin. “What if we just change one part about the story? Focus on one character.” </p><p>“Ohhh! That could work,” Dinky beamed. “We could totally hone in on Achillies being gay!” The trio glanced at her. “What?”</p><p>“OR,” Apple Bloom carried on after clearing her throat. “We could reinvent one of the central figures in the story. Helen of Sparta.” </p><p>“Wasn’t it Helen of Troy?” Sweetie asked. </p><p>Scootaloo shook her head, “My mum told me about this when she and dad were excavating the real Troy in Turkey.” Dinky’s mouth made a comical O. “See, when Paris seduced or stole Helen away from her husband Menelaus, she was Helen of Sparta. She only became Helen of Troy after marrying Paris and as the war progressed.” </p><p>“Typical machismo thing to do, am I right?” Dinky giggled. “Going to war over some chick.” </p><p>Sweetie smiled. “Rarity told me she was the most beautiful woman of her age.” </p><p>“But what if she was a warrior princess?” Apple Bloom interjected, smiling widely. “A fierce, intelligent woman playing the men in the war against one another. And able to best them in combat?”</p><p>The four girls considered the concept with a growing smile. “That’d be a hell of a lot cooler than her being some damsel in distress,” Scootaloo mused aloud. </p><p>“Could add an extra layer of intrigue to the whole war,” Sweetie agreed. </p><p>Dinky clapped excitedly, “Let’s do it! Who’s doing what?”</p><p>The tomboy grinned, “I can do the historical research to back the concept up, no problem.”</p><p>Diny beamed, “I’d love to write it! Do we wanna do a play or a dramatic reading?”</p><p>“Let’s go dramatic reading, girls,” Sweetie beamed. “Miss Adagio said I need to practice my range.”</p><p>Apple Bloom smirked, “Ah rekcon that leaves me makin’ a pretty poster board ta present this all on. Does that sound good ta y’all?” The four nodded and got to work, chattering happily amongst themselves. </p><hr/><p>Big Macintosh was not the kind of man who was interested in fashion. While Applejack’s friend Rarity squealed at the sight of elaborate costumes, fine fabrics, and glitzy jewelery, he’d never seen what the fuss was all about. As a farmer, he preferred practical clothes he could move around in and, as a naturist, he didn’t feel obligated to wear them at all while he worked on the farm most of the time. </p><p>It made finding something suitable to wear for his date frustrating at best and a nightmare at worst. While he was no stranger to casual dating, this was, in all likelihood, going to develop into a serious relationship (<i>as in potential marriage candidate</i>) and he wanted to leave a good first impression.</p><p>His workwear was obviously out. The big man pondered while he browsed through his dresser. Likewise, his collection of collared plaid shirts was a no go. It had been more than enough for Apple Bloom’s orientation but for a date, he needed something with a little more flair. Likewise, his trusty blue jeans were abandoned, which narrowed his options considerably. </p><p>His old prom suit could work but Mac wasn’t sure if it would be suitable. He hardly wanted to imply he was still reliving his ‘<i>high school days</i>’. Besides, he’d put on a substantial amount of muscle weight. After trying on the suit jacket, he realized that he was in danger of tearing the garment along the shoulders. </p><p>He had a white dress shirt, black slacks, and bow tie he kept around for the rare business meetings held off the farm. While they’d certainly be fine, it was a little bland and Mae had hinted that she was picking out something special to wear. Mac sighed and decided that he couldn’t wear those either. </p><p>The only remaining option was an outfit gifted to him by Coriander Cumin. A Hindi design, the shirt was brightly colored and designed more like a tunic, coming down to Mac’s knees. The pants were loose and made of silver silk while the matching shoes were soft around his feet. The big man looked at himself in the mirror and winced. </p><p>“I sure hope she doesn’t take this as cultural appropriation…”</p><p>“Macky? What’re ya doing in here?” Granny Smith remarked from the doorway, peering in. Her eyes widened and she snickered. “The Maharaja called, said he wants his duds back fer a state dinner.” </p><p>“Granny!”</p><p>“Don’t git yer testes in twist, boy. I’m just teasin’ ya. Why’re ya wearin’ that awful outfit in the first place?” </p><p>Mac tried to adjust the shirt. “Mah date with Daisy Mae is this Friday. Ah’d like to knock her socks off.”</p><p>“Ah certainly hope ya knock off more than just her socks. It’s be a helluva borin’ way ta end yer date otherwise.”</p><p>“Granny!”</p><p>The Apple Matriarch walked up and lightly smacked her grandson on the back, “Ah know fer a fact that young folks such as yerself like gettin’ frisky as soon as the opportunity presents itself.” Biting her lip she looked him over. “Ya don’t got anything else ta wear?”</p><p>“Ah don’t exactly own as many suits as Uncle Orange…”</p><p>Granny Smith rolled her eyes, “And why should ya? Waste o’ good money ownin’ more suits than the trees in our orchard.” Nodding to herself in the mirror, she remarked. “Mac, take that damn thing off and come to mah room. I might have something more suitable. Still oughta impress yer teacher friend too.” Almost absent-mindedly she left the room. </p><p>Shrugging, Mac stripped as instructed and folded up the silky garments into a neat pile. Scratching his chest, he walked down the hall towards Granny’s room. The house’s master bedroom had been Granny’s as long as Mac could remember. </p><p>Upon entering, he smiled at the wall of pictures of various family members, living and dead, on the walls. Around half were shots of them clothed and the other half were them nude at some family reunion or another. While not all their extended family were nudists, all had dipped their toes in the water at least once. </p><p>Beyond the pictures, the room was crammed with old knick-knacks and a shelf of romance novels and vintage vinyl records. A canopy four poster bed occupied the room’s center with a solid oak coffee table. A bottle of whiskey sat, half empty, on top. When Mac approached Granny, she was busy rummaging through her small walk-in closet. </p><p>“What’s all this about?” Mac asked. </p><p>“When yer father first started seeing yer mother, Ah wasn’t too pleased.” Granny Smith said, ignoring his question. “Pear Butter was, well, a Pear and we had a silly feud going on with that family. Ah gave Bright Mac such a tongue lashin’ when Ah found he was smitten with her.” She turned with an old garment bag clasped to her chest. “But Bright Mac was a hopeless romantic. Kept seein’ her and brought me around and I’ll be damned if by the end that gal turned into a honorary daughter o’ mine.” </p><p>The older Apple coughed to dispel the thickening of her voice, “Anywho, Bright Mac liked clothes about as much as any of us but when he dressed, he knew how to do it in style. He was mighty clever that way. Combined practicality with style.”</p><p>Laying the garment bag on her bed, she slowly unzipped it. “Ah always meant tah give this to ya at some point. Applejack may well have gotten his stetson but ah always felt ya deserved his ‘<i>lady killer</i>’ suit.”</p><p>Mac whistled as Granny carefully laid out the outfit, smoothing it with a soft smile. A pair of dark brown slacks with apples embroidered on the pockets, a belt with a shining apple buckle and a sleek blue dress shirt with a popped collar were laid out before them. Topping them all off was a familiar worn brown leather buckskin jacket with a short fringe. Touching it, he smiled. </p><p>“Ah thought we lost this…”</p><p>“Nope,” Granny swallowed. “Ah held onto it after the accident. Sentimental Ah know but… it’s the only other suit Ah gave him besides the one he was born in.” She shared a chuckle with her grandson. “This outfit was the one that most screamed Bright Mac to me. Ah reckon it’s time fer it ta have a new owner. Try it on, Mac.”</p><p>Carefully, Mac pulled the clothing on, breathing in the faint scent of cologne and firewood that reminded him of his late father. To his surprise, the outfit fit like a glove as if it was tailored especially for him. While he donned the jacket, he heard a stifled sob.</p><p>Granny Smith’s eyes were glossy as she held her hand to her mouth. Wordlessly, Mac embraced his grandmother. She clutched him tight and muttered a phrase that sounded like ‘<i>my boy</i>’ before composing herself once more.</p><p>She smiled, wiping her eyes. “Any lady who doesn’t feel weak in the knees at the sight o’ ya doesn’t deserve ta have ya in the first place.”</p><p>Mac chuckled. “Shouldn’t be a problem fer Daisy-Mae.” </p><p>Granny smirked playfully, “Ah suppose it wouldn’t. Considerin’ that she sent ya a nudie pic. Awful bold o’ her, doncha think? Hehehe.” </p><p>“How’d ya know about that?!”</p><p>Granny shrugged. “Apple Bloom told me. Now, go on and gimme a look see.” </p><p>Flushing, Mac retrieved his phone and opened up his messages. Scrolling past the more fluffy stuff, he found the photo in question. He hesitantly handed it to his grandmother. He watched as she made a scene of squinting her eyes comically. </p><p>“Boy howdy! She’s a real looker, ain’t she?” Rubbing her chin she mused. “I’ll bet she’s got a shapely pair o’ hips ta match them milkers. Not bad, Macky.” </p><p>“Granny, stop! Daisy-Mae ain’t some piece o’ meat.”</p><p>“Quit yer caterwauling, boy. Hot dang! Kids nowadays are so bashful. Wouldn’t hurt ta be more honest about yer bodies.” Sobering, she placed a hand on his shoulder. “Does she know about our lifestyle?”</p><p>Mac rubbed the back of his neck, “Not that Ah know of…”</p><p>“Well, you oughta tell her sooner rather than later. Ah know yer serious about this gal but ya need to be honest with her from the start. Have Ah made mahself plain?”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>“Good. Now then, unless I’m mistaken, that fence on the northern grove still needs fixin’. Hang up your daddy’s suit and grab the toolkit.”</p><hr/><p>Apple Bloom stuck her tongue out as she carefully pasted a drawing of their new and improved version of Helen of Troy onto the poster board. Dinky had shown quite the flair for artistic design when she sketched the princess. While Helen had the classic appearance of a fashion model, her physique and bearing were that of a calculating warrior. Over a flowing white dress she wore a bronze breastplate and greaves while half of her golden hair was shaved down one side. In her hands she held twin dirks while at her feet, the body of Achilles lay dead. </p><p>The story they’d crafted for her was that of a cunning strategist. Sent to Troy by her husband, she was supposed to infiltrate and undermine the city. Instead, she fell in love with the boyish, but kind Paris. As the war progressed, Helen played both sides against one another in an effort to bring about peace. </p><p>Apple Bloom pondered while she leant back in the library chair. Just about everything was coming together except the research. Beside her, Sweetie was pacing with their script in hand, mouthing along as she memorized the lines. Opposite of Apple Boom, Dinky was typing away on a laptop with several, handsome anime characters (<i>mostly pretty boys</i>) pasted on it, tongue stuck out in concentration. The chair reserved for Scootaloo sat empty. </p><p>“Any other changes ya wanna made Sweetie?” Dinky asked with a grin as she looked up from her keyboard. Sweetie and Dinky had bonded during the course of the project and having Dinky around had been a lot of fun, Apple Bloom had to admit. </p><p>Sweetiee bit her lip, “I think we should spice up the final speech. It should reflect on the futility of conflict or, perhaps, how the men admired Helen for her grace and beauty rather than her brilliant mind?”</p><p>Apple Bloom blinked, “Hold yer horses, gals. Y’all ain’t set on writin’ an entire Shakesperian production are ya?”</p><p>“Nope,” The blonde girl giggled, rubbing her head. “A one-act play, at most!”</p><p>“Ah suppose if Sweetiee is alright with performin’ it and Scoots can find the historical precedence ta back it up…”</p><p>“Where is she?” Sweetie asked, slightly annoyed. “We’ve already been here for almost an hour!” A shushing noise from deeper into the library caused her to roll her eyes and lower her voice. “She better not be blowing us off for something stupid. Like skateboarding or some other sporty-type thing. I don’t know!”</p><p>“I’m sure she just got caught up in somethin’ else.” Apple Bloom offered with a shrug. The tone of her voice suggested that she wasn’t very confident with her assessment.  </p><p>Dinky giggled, “She <b>DID</b> joke about doing her work the night before.”</p><p>“Ha! I doubt she was joking. Why can’t Scoots be more like you? Reliable, dependable and hardworking.”</p><p>The blonde exchanged a look with the redheaded farm girl, “Ummm, not sure I follow Sweetie.”</p><p>Sweetie waved her hand dismissively. “Nevermind. Apple Bloom, be a dear and text Scootaloo, would ya?” </p><p>Apple Bloom shrugged and took out her phone, bringing up Scootaloo’s number. Typing quickly, she noticed Sweetie opening her own phone and scrolling through some social media app. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#5E51A3">Scoots, where the hell are you? We’ve got a project to work on. </span></p><p>The response wasn’t long in coming. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#E97135">Sorry AB. Totally got held up doing other… stuff. Can we meet tomorrow instead? </span></p><p>Apple Bloom sighed, “Looks like she’s busy fer the time bein’. At least we’ve still got a few more days left before-”</p><p>“<b>I KNEW IT</b>!” Sweetie hissed while shoving her phone in Apple Bloom’s face. </p><p>Uncrossing her eyes, the farm girl looked at Sweetie’s screen carefully. It was Rainbow Dash’s page feed. The picture consisted of her posing for a selfie on a nearby soccer field. Pressed up beside her, with a ball under one arm, was Scootaloo, grinning ear to ear. The caption read: ‘<span style="font-style:italic;color:#6AAADD">Brushing up on my mad football skills with Scoots</span>’ while the timestamp read just over an hour ago. </p><p>“Shit,” Apple Bloom muttered. “Ya could’ve told us ya had other plans.”</p><p>“She’s blowing us off! Again!” Sweetiee fumed.</p><p>Apple Bloom frowned. “Ah know yer mad, Sweetie. Ah am too. But could ya please calm down? We’ll talk to her about this tomorrow and-”</p><p>“This is totally unacceptable! It’s a group project not a ‘<i>I’ll screw around with Rainbow Dash while my friends pick up the slack</i>’ project!”</p><p>“Sweetie, that’s not ok. Scoots is-” Apple Bloom found that she was talking to Sweetie’s backside as the irate girl stormed out of the library. Dinky and Apple Bloom quickly gathered their stuff up and raced after her. </p><p>They found Sweetie with her fists clenched just outside the library. The usually cheerful girl was fuming but abruptly took in a deep breath and exhaled. As the two approached her she smiled and whipped her phone out. “Selfie time!”</p><p>“What do ya-”</p><p>“Smile!” She beamed cheerfully taking a picture of herself, Bloom and Dinky and the library. Typing on her phone she began to walk away. “How would you girls like some refreshments at my place? Seems like we’re done working on the project today.”</p><p>Dinky blinked, “Sweetie, are you sure you’re ok?”</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I be? I’m working on a group project with some of my best friends!” Her smile wasn’t entirely genuine as she pressed a button on her phone. “Everyone should know that.”</p><p>Apple Bloom’s phone vibrated in her pocket. Upon opening it, she frowned at a new tag notification. She realized that Sweetie had commented on Rainbow’s post with a selfie message of her own stating: <span style="font-style:italic;color:#5E51A3">Looking good! So blessed to be working on a group project today with my friends. @Anime-Blonde @Apple-Bloom @Chicken-Scoots. </span></p><p>“What’ve ya done now?” Apple Bloom asked. </p><p>Her friend flashed her the same exaggerated smile, “Whatever do you mean? I enjoy sharing how blessed I am with Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo. Come along now.”</p><p>The young Apple couldn’t quite shake her sense of unease as they followed Sweetie Belle to her sister’s apartment downtown. Located in the gentrified district near the university, it was a fairly trendy building built above an old boutique. Sweetie had mentioned her sister was working there part-time and was considering buying the place once she completed her degree. </p><p>Sweetie seemed her usual bubbly self when she served Bloom and Dinky some eclairs and juice. Apple Bloom couldn’t help but notice an undercurrent of bitter frustration lurking just beneath her polite facade. The farmgirl sighed as she downed a glass of orange juice and spent her time studying her surroundings. </p><p>Rarity’s apartment was pretty much what Apple Bloom had expected a fashion-loving artist’s home would be. While tidy and clean, there was a sense of controlled chaos with rolls of fabric tucked neatly beside canvases, blank and painted. In fact, the teenager realized, with a smirk, that one of the paintings hanging on the wall was Applejack posing in all her natural splendor. Scattered across the room were mannequins with various half-finished outfits displayed upon them.</p><p>After a half-hour of chatting with Dinky and Sweetie, Apple Bloom had nearly forgotten the sense of unease she’d felt earlier. It reappeared when she heard a frantic knock on the door and the familiar voice of Scootaloo call out, “Girls? Are you in there? We need to talk.”</p><p>Sweetie adopted a neutral expression as she rose from the couch they’d all been sitting on, “Finally.” Apple Bloom got up and followed her friend. Opening the door with a fake smile, she cooed. “Well, isn’t this a surprise? I don’t ever recall inviting you over.”</p><p>Scootaloo was still clad in a pair of loose gym shorts, sneakers, and a sports bra. Her hair was a frazzled, sweaty mess. She immediately winced at Sweetie’s expression, “Sweetie, listen I’m-”</p><p>“All done working on your mad football skills?” The girl blithely replied. “Must have slipped your mind that Rainbow Dash asked you to help her practice, hmmm?”</p><p>“C’mon, Sweetie. I already feel like a douche-nozzle, ok? RD just called me up and asked for help. She’s practically my big sister. You know that I can’t say no to any of her requests. Can you please just let me in?”</p><p>Sweetie placed a hand across the doorway, “OH, NO! This is a private function. For that project, we were working on today? Like you AGREED to?”</p><p>“Hey! You don’t have to be such a massive bitch about it, Sweetie. Apple Bloom, tell her would ya?”</p><p>The farmgirl sighed and rubbed her face, “Scoots, ya promised ta work with us at the library. Sweetie has every right ta be upset with ya.” </p><p>“Mhmm. In fact, Dinky says she can do the research tonight like any good friend would.” Sweetie sneered. “You can just go back to playing with balls.” </p><p>The tomboy’s face turned dark red, “I’m still in the process of getting the research done, Sweetie.”</p><p>“Is that so? Well, don’t let me hold you up.” Sweetie replied with a high pitched laugh before slamming the door in her face. </p><p>“Hey! What the hell, Sweetie?!”</p><p>“After school hangouts are reserved for friends <b>WHO DON’T LIE AND BLOW ME OFF TO SCREW AROUND PLAYING SOCCER INSTEAD</b>!” Sweetie yelled back, arms crossed.</p><p>Apple Bloom grabbed Sweetie’s arm, “Hold up! That was totally uncalled fer! Scoots is our friend, even if she tends ta make mistakes sometimes. We all do.” </p><p>The girl rubbed her moisture from her eyes, “Then she should start acting like it!” Sniffing, Sweetie stomped back to Dinky who had a wide-eyed look of confusion. Cursing, Apple Bloom opened the door to see Scootaloo heading for the stairs.</p><p>“Come back!” She called out as she ran after the tomboy. Fit though she was, it took Apple Bloom a fair bit of effort to catch up with Scootaloo just outside the apartment. The young athlete was sobbing and kicking the ground angrily.</p><p>“Scootaloo…”</p><p>“What the hell is wrong with her?! She’s acting like Diamond Tiara!” Scootaloo raged, furiously rubbing her eyes. “She knows I’ll get the project done eventually! I just…”</p><p>“C’mere, you,” Apple Bloom whispered while she wrapped her friend in a hug. “Sweetie’s just a tad upset. I’m sure once she calms down, we can work this out.” </p><p>“Do you agree with her about the whole ditching thing?”</p><p>“Ah don’t think ya should’ve lied ta us and left us out ta dry. However, Ah don’t think ya meant ta hurt anyone on purpose.” Apple Bloom replied. “How about ya come upstairs with me and we can-”</p><p>“Damn it,” Scootaloo muttered, breaking the embrace. “Looks like I’ve got some research to do. Catch ya later, Bloom. Tell Sweetie to stop acting like a spoiled brat.” Scootaloo stormed away in a huff, leaving Apple Bloom on the sidewalk.</p><p>Apple Bloom buried her face in her hands and groaned. “The drama Ah gotta deal with…” </p><hr/><p>Daisy-Mae hummed happily to herself as she tidied up the classroom and organized her desk. School had just let out, but more importantly, her date with Big Macintosh was tonight. Mae resisted the impulse to spin on one heel and giggle like a teenager. </p><p>In truth, she hadn’t been entirely sure that returning home to teach at her old school was a good idea. She’d been away so long and after all her travels, she was worried that the community would feel too small. Besides, with no significant other she was worried she’d end up as some old schoolmarm. </p><p>Instead, she’d been greeted warmly by her friends, family and even her old teachers. Her students, barring a few troublemakers, were great and eager to hear about her travels. The icing on the cake was Big Mac coming back into her life.</p><p>How such a handsome hunk didn’t have a wife by now, Mae honestly didn’t know. Texting him these last few days had made her feel like a teenager again. His clever wit and gentlemanly nature made her heart flutter. In fact, she only had one cause for concern but she intended to bring that up tonight.</p><p>“Miss Cheerliee? Can Ah talk with ya fer a second?” A familiar voice asked. </p><p>Looking up, Daisy-Mae smiled at the fidgeting form of Apple Bloom warmly, “Of course, Apple Bloom. My door is always open.” She patted a chair in front of her desk as she rested against it. “What can I help you with? Any trouble with the group project?”</p><p>“Kinda,” Apple Bloom replied as she sat down, placing her bag by her feet. “It’s more than that. But um… shoot! Ah hate all o’ this silly drama nonsense. Ah shouldn’t even bother ya with it.” She began to get up but Mae gently grabbed her hand. </p><p>“Apple Bloom, I’m here for you. For all my students, in fact. If you need help just ask me, ok?” She flushed. “Besides, you might be seeing more of me soon.”</p><p>The redhead perked up, “Yer date with mah brother is tonight, ain’t it? Can’t wait ta see what dress ya picked out.” </p><p>“He told you about that?” Mae asked, surprise evident in her tone. </p><p>“I’m the one who convinced him that takin’ a selfie was the right way ta go. Mah brother must really like ya. He ain’t the most photogenic fella ‘round.”</p><p>“Well then,” Daisy-Mae coughed. “Thank you, I suppose. I’ll tell you what, I’ll make sure he takes a nice picture of us on our date, ok?”</p><p>“Thank ya, Miss Cheerliee!” Apple Bloom grinned. </p><p>“Now, what’s troubling you?”</p><p>The farm girl sighed and leaned back in her chair. “Ah don’t know if you’ve noticed but Sweetie, Scootaloo, and Ah are best friends. We’re like peas in a pod! But lately, Sweetie and Scoots have been bumpin’ heads like a couple o’ billygoats. They had a pretty nasty spat yesterday over the project.” At Cheerliee’s nod, she went on. “Scootaloo blew us off ta hang out with Rainbow Dash. They’re practically sisters. She’s been doing that… a lot lately and it’s been makin’ Sweetie downright furious.”</p><p>“I see,” Cheerliee hummed. “Sounds like teenage drama.”</p><p>“I’m worried that if this keeps festerin’, they’ll start hatin’ each other. Ah don’t know what ta do ta make those two sit down and have a heart ta heart.”</p><p>Mae tapped her desk absentmindedly, “Sweetie seems like a rather prideful girl to me. It’s unlikely that she’d tell Scootaloo what’s wrong of her own volition.” Bloom nodded sadly. “Scootaloo, although well-intentioned, is a bit socially awkward. She seems to lack self-confidence too, leading her to seek validation from others.”</p><p>“Wow. Ya got all o’ that from bein’ around us fer a month?”</p><p>“I do have a knack for teaching,” The woman admitted with an embarrassed chuckle. “Getting to know your students is part of the job description. The best thing you can do for Sweetie and Scootaloo is to get them out of their respective comfort zones.” </p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Spreading her hands, Mae explained, “They need to be on a level playing field where it’s just the three of you. Find a way to put them both on edge, so that they have to be honest. Make them think, not about themselves, but your relationship with each other.” </p><p>“Ah think Ah understand,” Bloom mumbled, her eyes brightening. “Ah could invite them ta the Acres fer snacks and whatnot, then spring mah plan! Thank ya, Miss Cheerliee, yer the best!” She squealed, wrapping her teacher in a hug. </p><p>Cheerliee returned it with a wide smile, “Don’t you forget it! Need anything else?”</p><p>Breaking the hug, Apple Bloom shook her head, “Nope! Ah should be fine. Enjoy yer date with Mac tonight!” The girl positively skipped from the classroom, leaving her teacher smiling widely. Coming home turned out to be the best decision she had ever made. She could feel it. Well, second-best, if things with Mac went the way she hoped.</p><hr/><p>Big Mac exhaled deeply as he removed the keys from his truck’s ignition. His father’s suit fit him like a glove. It also helped calm his racing heart and fluttering stomach. While Mac was far from a fresh-faced youth, he had been out of the dating game for a while. He knew that no date was ever perfect, but he sent a silent prayer that this one would be as close to perfect as possible. </p><p>Exiting the truck, he looked around the modest downtown street where Daisy-Mae made her home. One of the older parts of the community, the buildings were constructed of brick and had a dignified, turn of the century look to them. </p><p>Crossing the street, the big farmer walked up to Cheerilee’s apartment building, and rang the buzzer for her number. He then spent the next minute pacing in the main lobby, coming up with a dozen smooth and suave greetings. All of that melted right away when she stepped out of the elevator.</p><p>Mae had somehow managed to make herself look even prettier than she had been at orientation day. Her hair was tied up in a loose bun held in place with two golden hairpins, allowing her bangs to fall across one eye. Her makeup was sparse but what little eyeshadow she used brought out her green eyes. A hint of blush applied to her cheeks and some pink lipstick drew his eyes to her smile. </p><p>The dress, meanwhile, did not fail to impress. A sleek red number, the design was clearly oriental, with a golden dragon embroidered on the front. It hugged Mae’s bosom tightly, showing off her cleavage. A long slit starting just below her hips revealed pale flashes of her legs and the golden high heels adorning her feet. </p><p>“Evening Mac. Like what you see?” Mae asked, twirling in a circle. “I picked this up in <i>Chiang Mai</i> on a trip.” </p><p>Mac took her hand and kissed it, “Mae, you look radiant tonight. Dunno what ya spent on that dress but it was worth every penny.”</p><p>“You sure clean up well yourself. Did you have that outfit personally tailored?” Cheerilee replied with a slight blush. </p><p>“It was mah daddy’s suit, actually. Granny said she was keepin’ it stowed away fer a special occasion.” </p><p>Mae patted his chest and smoothed his jacket. Kissing his cheek she whispered, “You look fabulous. Shall we?”</p><p>“Your chariot awaits,” Mac quipped as the two-headed for his truck.</p><p>They spent the drive to the <i>Tasty Treat</i> chatting about nothing of real importance, catching up on gossip and discussing their favourite television programs. Mac was gratified the conversation flowed not only smoothly but naturally. In no time at all, they were pulling up to the restaurant. </p><p><i>The Tasty Treat </i>was as flamboyantly Hindi in design as its owners. The exterior of the building featured a large neon sign with a kaleidoscopic elephant logo on full display. The moment Mac and Cheerliee entered its lobby, a world of colorful hanging silk tapestries, mesmerizing murals, and colored lamps greeted them. The air smelled of exotic spices and cooking food. The simple wooden tables were crowded with people of all ages. Hindi pop played softly from the speakers further enhancing the place’s ambience. </p><p>The two of them were barely in the lobby for a minute before Coriander Cumin hurried over to them, a wide smile on his face. As owner of <i>the Tasty Treat</i>, he joked with guests, organized the wait staff, and brought a larger than life personality to every task that he performed, no matter how big or small it was.</p><p>“Macintosh, my friend, namaste!” Cumin called out. Halting before them, he clasped his hands together and bowed. A gesture that both Mac and Mae returned automatically. “And you must be Daisy-Mae. Please, come in.”</p><p>Mac offered his arm to Mae who took it with a smile, pressing up against him. He reckoned they looked like quite the dashing couple as they followed Cumin. Mac noted more than a few men and women shot the two jealous looks, which made him blush. He wasn’t used to this type of attention. Glancing at the look Mae was giving him Mac felt his nerves melt away like snow from the sun. </p><p>“Here we are. Please, sit and order some of my daughter’s delicious food. Can I get you some drinks?” Coriander asked as he pulled the chairs out from their table. </p><p>Located right across from the open kitchen, the table gave them a full view of the dozen cooks currently preparing a wide range of food. At the center was the shapely form of Saffron Masala, her long black hair tied back in a braid as she ordered her staff around. At the sight of Mac, she waved and smiled broadly, which he returned with a grin of his own.</p><p>“She seems to like you,” Cheerilee remarked as she took her seat. </p><p>Mac laughed, “We met through our family businesses. Saff is a sweet gal.” </p><p>“I certainly should hope so! I raised her,” Cumin chortled. “Can I get you two some drinks? Some of your family’s excellent whiskey, perhaps?”</p><p>“I’ll take that with mah supper, thanks. I’ll take water for now. Mae?”</p><p>The teacher took a brief glance over the drink menu, “A water for me as well, please. I’ll also take some of that whiskey with our meal.”</p><p>“Very good. Signal me when you’re ready to order.”</p><p>For about two minutes they poured over their menus and chatted about the dishes. They were a mix of traditional Hindi dishes, western fare and fusion dishes unique to Saffron’s own culinary genius. When Coriander returned with the drinks, Daisy Mae ordered some fish curry with steamed rice while Mac chose her classic butter chicken recipe. The two also ordered a plate of naan bread to share together. </p><p>“You’re business partners with the Tasty Treat?” Mae asked, sipping her water. </p><p>Mac nodded and smiled proudly, “Apple Family Whiskey is prized throughout the area. We supply most of the restaurants and bars and make a decent profit doing it.” He coughed. “Course, it’s a family affair. Ah reckon AJ is of a mind ta expand our customer base after she gets that fancy business degree.” </p><p>Cheerliee smiled, “Higher education is its own reward. Did you ever get a degree?”</p><p>“Afraid not. When Ah graduated high school that was it for me. Granny was pullin’ her own weight but she was gettin’ old and mah sisters were still kids.” He shrugged. “If Ah wanna learn about somethin’, I’ll git a book, in case ya think I’m some uncultured bumpkin…” Mac shut his mouth as he realized he was rambling. </p><p>Mae beamed at Mac and grasped his hand, “Not at all! I know I’ve said it before but I think it’s very admirable how you took care of your family.”</p><p>“Thanks.” </p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p>The two were interrupted by Coriander arriving with their naan appetizer. As they munched on the fried flatbread, Mac gestured to Cheerliee’s outfit, “Chiang Mai, eh?”</p><p>“Yes.” Mae beamed as she chewed on some bread. “I was teaching English in Bangkok at the time. I made friends with some local girls and they showed me around the country. Beautiful artisans in Northern Thailand and exquisite wildlife. I even got in a cage with a tiger.”</p><p>“An actual Tiger?!” Mac chortled. “Ah didn’t realize Ah was takin’ a bonafide badass out fer dinner.” </p><p>The teacher rolled her eyes dramatically, “It wasn’t that big of a deal” She winked. “The tigers were probably drugged but it was still pretty terrifying. If one of them decided to eat me well…” Mae drew a finger across her throat and stuck her tongue out goofily. </p><p>“Did ya teach kids in Thailand?”</p><p>“Primarily, yes. I served in South Korea for a year and during the summers I’d backpack around Asia. Even visited India one time.” Mae related. “South East Asia and the Pacific are very beautiful parts of the world. Maybe not as safe as Europe but very vibrant.” </p><p>Mac shook his head, “Shoot, you’ve even been ta Europe?” When she nodded Mac whistled. “ The only time I’ve left the country was ta visit family back in Germany.” </p><p>“I take it your family is originally from there?”</p><p>“Suppose, ya could say that” Mac laughed. “Granny likes ta say that we Apples have a branch of the family tree in every country around the world.”</p><p>Mae snorted, “Your family’s seed appears to be in high demand.” As Mac flushed a bright red she chortled. “For apples, I mean.”</p><p>“Course ya do.”</p><p>For the next ten minutes, the two discussed Cheerliee’s extensive travels. Mac was in quiet awe at just how many countries the young educator had managed to visit. The stories she told of visiting bustling bazaars, free diving off coral reefs and being scammed by cabbies were exciting compared to life on the farm. </p><p>By contrast, Mac felt that discussing his own profession might bore her, but he found that Cheerliee listened with rapt attention. He danced around the subject of the family lifestyle for the most part and inwardly berated himself for it. Granny had told him to be honest, and that’s just what he was going to do. </p><p>“Sweet Apple Acres sounds like a little slice of heaven,” Cheerliee sighed. “You know, as a little girl, I dreamed about living on a farm one day. Silly, huh?”</p><p>Mac felt his heart skip a beat, “Not at all, Mae. It’s a lot o’ hard work, but a good life. Mah family is quite taken with it.” He braced himself. “There is somethin’ you should know-”</p><p>“I’ve got my special butter chicken for Macintosh and a fish curry with rice for his lady.” Saffron smiled broadly as she set the plates of steaming delicious smelling plates before them. “It’s been a while since we last spoke, Mac.”</p><p>The farmer smiled, “Saff, didn’t know you were bussing tables.”</p><p>“She is not,” Coriander fumed as he hustled to their table with a decanter of whiskey and two glasses. “That is my job unless she wants me to do all the cooking.”</p><p>“Please, <i>pita,</i> we want customers to return” Saffron replied with a smirk. </p><p>Her father smiled as he set his tray on their table and poured a generous amount of whiskey into each glass. “I am a competent chef! Your mother says so. Besides, you are embarrassing Macintosh and his date. Away with you!”</p><p>“It ain’t a problem, sir.”</p><p>Saffron winked, “See <i>pita, </i>it’s all good.” A commotion from the kitchen caused the dark-skinned woman to click her tongue. “Always something. Please, enjoy your meal.” As she left she patted Mae’s shoulder. “Quite the catch you have there.”</p><hr/><p>Coriander hurried off to another table leaving the couple alone once more. Daisy Mae smiled at the display of familial bickering and the reaction it had elicited from Mac. The big man was adorable when he blushed which, she’d noticed with satisfaction, was happening a lot in her presence. Once again, she thanked her Thai friend Aranya for insisting that she buy the dress a few years ago.</p><p>Cheerilee couldn’t help but feel nervous herself. She feared that discussing her travels around the world had made Mac feel like a country bumpkin. Thankfully, he’d seemed genuinely interested in her tales and getting to know her. But he seemed… hesitant to discuss his home life beyond basic details.</p><p>Mae raised her glass of whiskey in a toast which Mac returned, “To old friends.”</p><p>“Old friends,” He replied in his delightful rustic twang. Clinking their glasses together, they both downed a finger-worth of whiskey. Mac hadn’t been joking, Mae realized. This stuff was smooth and strong</p><p>As the pleasant warmth spread, they began to dig into their meal. Saffron’s fish curry, as expected, was delicious. Mae relished the subtle flavours and textures that the master chef had brought to the dish. Glancing over at Mac, she marvelled at how he was putting away his own meal with a boyish grin spread ear to ear.</p><p>Dabbing her lips with a napkin, Mae asked, “Were you and Saffron ever an item?”</p><p>Macintosh nodded. “We went out on a few dates just ta test the waters. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out between us. We stayed friends though. Besides, mah lifestyle wasn’t somethin’ she wanted ta git involved with.”</p><p>“You mentioned that before,” Mae seized on the opportunity to address her concerns. “Are you some type of religious fundamentalist?”</p><p>“Eenope,” Mac waved his hand, body subtly tensing, she noted. “Nothin’ like that! If Ah tell ya, can ya promise me that ya won’t freak out?” </p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>The big farmer adjusted his collar, “May Ah be frank?” She nodded eagerly. “Ah like ya a lot. I think yer smart, capable, open-minded and beautiful. Ah’d really like us ta, well, more than reconnect. Ah’d very much like ta go steady with ya.” Rubbing his arm he sighed. “The thing is: Ah don’t want ta be dishonest with ya. Ah want ta share all the aspects of mah life. Includin’ one aspect of it that’s a bit unconventional.” </p><p>Daisy Mae tapped her foot anxiously, hoping that he didn’t notice. “You can tell me, Mac. Honesty is the foundation of any good relationship alongside love and mutual attraction.” She took another swig of whiskey. “I’m not here just to kiss and tell.”</p><p>“So long as yer sure.” Squaring his shoulder Mac sighed. “Mah family and Ah are naturists. Have been for generations. That means, more often than not, we don’t bother wearin’ anythin’ most o’ the time.” The big man braced himself. </p><p>Mae let out something between a giggle and sigh of relief. “Is that all?”</p><p>“Beg yer pardon?”</p><p>“I was rather worried that you were going to tell me your family was part of some polygamous cult.” Daisy Mae joked.</p><p>“Yer not… offended by the way we live?”</p><p>Cheerilee reached over and placed her hand atop Mac’s, using her thumb to rub it gently. “I’ve heard some of the rumours swirling around about your family. Ponyville is a small community. People talk. I remember when AJ and her friend had that falling out a few years ago.” </p><p>“Right…”</p><p>“Take a look at this.” She giggled, taking out her phone and opening up their messages. Scrolling to his selfie she enhanced it and zoomed in over his shoulder. “The family pond has a rather mirror-like quality, don’t you think?”</p><p>The flush that spread across his face delighted the teacher. It matched the one she’d had when she’d noticed the near-perfect reflection of Macintosh’s toned, bare buns in the background. “Work on the farm certainly hasn’t done you any harm.”</p><p>“Damn it! Ah knew sendin’ that selfie was a bad idea. Ya must think I’m a creep.”</p><p>Daisy Mae shushed him, “A creep would have just sent me a picture of his penis. It’s pretty clear to me that you didn’t realize you were giving me such a sexy glimpse into your life.” As the man relaxed, she smiled. “Have you ever visited one of those nudist colonies?” </p><p>“That ain’t the proper term fer... ” Mae couldn’t help but giggle again and watched as his eyes narrowed with mock malice. “Yer terrible, Daisy Mae.” </p><p>“In all seriousness, tell me about it. Do you walk around naked just for fun?” She asked, her heart beating a little faster as her mind drifted back to the feeling of the sun on her skin. </p><p>Mac took another bite of his butter chicken, “Ah ain’t some exhibitionist. Ah’d like ta make that clear. It’s about lovin’ yer body, healthy livin’, and just bein’ your most authentic self. A candy without the need fer a wrapper, ah guess you could say.” He shrugged. “There are plenty o’ benefits ta be had. Saves a ton o’ money on laundry and in this-here subtropical climate, bein’ nekkid is the most practical way ta farm.” </p><p>Mae laughed, “Well, you certainly have thought this over.”</p><p>“Ah oughta,” Mac remarked with a chuckle. “Didn’t want ta completely lose mah chance with ya.”</p><p>“Nonsense! You’ve lost nothing.” She replied. “If anything, you’ve gained my trust. I take it your entire family lives the same way you do?” </p><p>“Eeyep. It’s an intergenerational thing. Hell, one time Granny went a full year without wearing anything, just ta say she did.”</p><p>The teacher shook her head, “Is Apple Bloom ok with it?”</p><p>“Sure is. Heck, she’s the reason me and Applejack are bein’ more open about it these days. In fact, ya might have her ta blame fer our date this evenin’,” Mac said as he finished off the last of his meal.</p><p>“She’s very mature for her age, I wonder if that comes with her upbringing?”</p><p>The farmer smiled fondly, “Apple Bloom’s always been a bright gal with a good head on her shoulders. One o’ AJ’s new friends, Roz, is a naturist but she can be pretty damn childish sometimes. Winnona wound up lickin’ the gravy off o’ her breasts durin’ supper.” Cheerliee giggle-snorted and hid it by hastily drinking some more whiskey. “It’s endearing in a way, Ah suppose.” </p><p>“I have noticed that people tend to be a bit more free-spirited while in the nude,” She replied absentmindedly. When she realized what she said she began to blush.</p><p>Mac rested his chin on his hands and smiled widely, “Ah do believe there’s a story there, Miss Cheerliee.”</p><p>“There just might be, Mr. Apple,” Daisy Mae replied, taking a sip of water to balance out her buzz. “I suppose you could say I had an experience of my own…”</p><p>The man’s eyes widened, “That so? Ah didn’t think you’d be the type.” He made a face. “Or rather, Ah hoped you’d be the type but didn’t think you’d tried it yet.”</p><p>Mae giggled and placed her chin in her own hand, “I like to consider myself an open-minded individual. When you’ve seen as much of the world as I have, it changes your perspective.” </p><p>“Ah bet. If ya don’t mind telling me…”</p><p>“Of course. You’re one of the only men I could tell this to who wouldn’t have his tongue wagging like a dog.” Exhaling, she cast her mind back to that sandy beach and the feeling of freedom. “When I was teaching in Thailand I became pretty good friends with a group of teachers. There was Fleur from France, Linn from China and Aranya, who was from Thailand itself. The four of us were as thick as thieves.”</p><p>Mac nodded, “Reckon it’s good ta have a few friends in a foreign country.”</p><p>“Absolutely critical,” Cheerliee replied. “We explored most of Southeast Asia together and beyond.” She smiled as images of riding in tuk-tuks, skirting piles of trash and taking in fantastic cultural exhibitions came to her mind. “Of course, we spent most of our time in Thailand and we loved visiting the south. Tropical islands and beaches aplenty. Beyond the odd torrential rainstorm, it’s practically a paradise.”</p><p>“Sounds interestin’,” Mac interjected as he took a swig of water. “I’ve heard Thailand has a small, but dedicated naturist community.”</p><p>Mae shrugged, “I don’t know about that but I do know there are some beautiful nude beaches you can visit on Phuket Island. On one of our trips, Aranya suggested we visit one. We’d invited along a few male teachers, including a German, named Klaus. Aranya was smitten and wanted to impress him by showing how bold she could be. She wanted us to come along for moral support.” She shrugged. “I’ll admit, Linn and I were pretty freaked out by it but Fleur convinced us to give it a try.”</p><p>The teacher turned her face up and closed her eyes, remembering the heat of the tropical sun. “We decided to go to this place called Nui Beach. It’s off the beaten track and on the Southern tip of the island. Kind of like a secret cove. Anyway, that day was pretty darn hot and I was sweating like a pig underneath my dress.” She joined him in laughing. “Super sexy, I know. When we finally arrived, the water was crystal clear, the beach was picturesque and there was this sense of… anticipation.”</p><p>Opening her eyes Mae looked into Mac’s, “By that point, my stomach was doing backflips. Linn looked like she was going to faint and Aranya’s confidence slipped. But then Fleur, cool as a cucumber, took off her clothes like it was the most natural thing in the world. That girl had the figure of a supermodel, I swear. That gave Arayna, Klaus, and his buddies the push they needed. I didn’t want to be left out either!” </p><p>She rubbed her arms and giggled. “I felt like every guy on the beach was ogling me but more people were checking Linn out in her skimpy, red bikini.” </p><p>“So what happened then?” Mac asked.</p><p>“Once Klaus and his buddies got ahold of themselves, we just had a normal day at the beach. We played volleyball, swam, and got an all-over tan. Well, if you count sunburn as a tan.” Mae flushed and shifted in her seat “Some mistakes were made.” </p><p>“Eeyup. That’s why ya gotta put on plenty o’ sunscreen. Did ya enjoy yer excursion ta the beach, despite what happened?” Mac asked cautiously. </p><p>Mae bit her lip, “Yes… actually. We ended up going back several times afterward. Linn eventually decided to go topless. And let’s just say that Klaus and Arayna hooked up there. I was just sad to leave it all behind when I came back here.”</p><p>“Ah don’t suppose you’d be willin’ ta try other activities?” The big man suggested. </p><p>“I might. Depending on who’s asking.” Mae replied in a husky voice, brushing her bare foot against Mac’s leg. While she giggled at his flustered reaction, the teacher whispered. “I’m talking about you, by the way. In case it wasn’t obvious... ”</p><p>Macintosh suddenly found the tablecloth interesting, “Are ya drunk?” </p><p>“No!” Cheerliee shot back primly, “Perhaps a bit tipsy. A sure sign that the whiskey you brewed is smooth and goes down easy.” Upon taking another sip of water she asked, “Speaking of activities, I was wondering if you might give me a tour of Sweet Apple Acres sometime? I always wanted to see it when we were teenagers.” </p><p>“Sure! Uh… if you’d be interested.”</p><p>“Wonderful!” Daisy Mae exclaimed while clapping her hands together. Inwardly, she felt like she was walking on clouds. The date had gone far better than she’d dared hope. In fact, she needed a memento of it. Flagging down Coriander, she scooted her chair so that she was side by side with Mac. Passing him her phone, she asked. “Would you mind taking a picture of us together?”</p><p>“Of course,” Coriander replied, taking the phone and leaning back. “Say, Tasty Treat is Number One!”</p><p>Throwing her arm over Mac’s broad shoulder, Daisy Mae pressed her face up against his and smiled as Coriander took a picture. Mac flushed but did the same, placing his hand on Mae’s bare hip. She squealed with joy internally as the portly man lowered the phone. “How about a kiss? For good luck!”</p><p>“Ah don’t know...” He mumbled. </p><p>Cheerliee tickled the bottom of Mac’s chin, “Please? For me?” She delighted in the way his big green eyes softened as he turned to her. Chastely, the two kissed, losing one another in the moment. Mac’s lips tasted of curry and whiskey, an unorthodox combination, but one that she quite enjoyed nonetheless. They broke apart after a minute or so when Coriander returned her phone. </p><p>“Might I interest you in dessert?”</p>
