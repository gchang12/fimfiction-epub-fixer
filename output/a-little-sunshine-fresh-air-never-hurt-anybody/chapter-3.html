		<h1>Sipping Coffee With A Fashionista</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 3</b></p><p>Sweet Apple Acres, Ponyville </p><p>A few days had passed since Sweetie Belle &amp; Scootaloo’s visit to the acres. On this particular day, Apple Bloom had gone out with her friends on yet another excursion, except this time, it was to shop and hang out at the mall. For what, exactly, she wasn’t clear on. Most likely due to the fact that most girls at her age tended to be interested in buying pretty clothes or underwear for themselves. However, as a naturist, Apple Bloom wasn’t too keen on buying or wearing either of those things. Only when necessary, of course. Otherwise, her tastes were similar to her siblings: plain, utilitarian undergarments and clothing that wouldn’t tear during farm work. </p><p>At the very least, she could buy herself a new bow or some accessories, Applejack mused. Jewelry and piercings weren’t too high on the priority list for the Apples either because they could get caught on things while you worked, causing all sorts of mechanical injuries. Regardless of if she were to buy anything today or not, Applejack was certain that her little sister would have fun. Sometimes, the company you kept with you was more important than the activity itself. </p><p>Applejack let out a frustrated sigh while she rocked back and forth in the hammock. Under normal circumstances, she loved to take naps out in the orchard with the scent of grass and applewood all around her. She never needed a blanket because the sun provided all the warmth she needed. Given that it was just after lunch and she had a full belly, Applejack should have felt sleepier, but was instead restless. She wiggled her toes anxiously while eyeballing her phone.   </p><p>While the freckled farmer didn’t consider herself a tech guru by any means, out of necessity, she bought a high-end smartphone to keep in contact with all of the family’s various clients. It was also convenient for keeping track of Apple Bloom whenever she went out. Currently, her red-colored phone (<i>with a trio of apples on the case</i>) sat in the grass, silent and unmoving. Absentmindedly, she slid her hand in-between her legs, scratched her silky blonde pubic hair, and wondered if she suddenly felt itchy down there just because she was anxious. </p><p>“Damn it,” Applejack huffed, “Why am Ah so bent outta shape over a stupid phone?” </p><p>Alas, it wasn’t so much the phone itself that she was worried about. Rather, a certain person she was expecting a call or maybe even just a text from. A person whom she hadn’t spoken with since high school graduation. One Rarity Belle, a former classmate and burgeoning fashionista, destined to make a name for herself. While they hadn’t been the closest of confidants, Applejack considered Rarity to be the most gregarious person out of all her former classmates and the most liable to accept an invitation to hang out. Even so, Applejack was uncertain if such a high-class lady like Rarity would want to spend her summer chatting with a simple farm girl. </p><p>Applejack nearly fell out of the hammock when her reverie was interrupted by a text notification. She carefully extracted herself from the twisted fabric and picked up her smartphone. An excited smile spread across her lips when she saw that the sender was Rarity. With her tongue sticking slightly out of the corner of her mouth, Applejack slowly, but surely began to tap out a reply on the screen. </p><blockquote><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#5E51A3">Good afternoon, darling. Sweetie Belle informed me that you might be interested in having a chat? If so, let us meet at the Mean Bean Café around two o’clock today</span><span style="color:#5E51A3">.</span> ☕</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#E97135">Howdy, Rarity. It’s AJ. Reckon I’d be up for that</span><span style="color:#E97135">. </span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#5E51A3">Splendid! I’ll see you then.</span><span style="color:#5E51A3"> </span> 😉</p></blockquote><p>Even though the conversation had been brief, it sent an electric thrill down Applejack’s spine. An unexpectedly girlish giggle left the blonde farmer’s mouth while she walked back to the farmhouse. Such a dramatic shift in Applejack’s typical behavior did not go unnoticed by Big Mac. The older sibling leaned against the stairs, swigging a beer languidly and watched as his sister had a noticeable spring in her barefooted step. Without missing a beat, Mac stepped in his little sister’s way and grinned when she let out an annoyed grunt.</p><p>“Hold up fer a second, AJ. What’s gotten ya flyin’ higher than a kite today?” </p><p>While Applejack was considerably strong herself, she was nothing compared to her mountain of a brother. She knew there was no way Mac was going to move until she answered his question. Skin flushed pink with anger, she sighed. “Got invited fer coffee from an acquaintance.”</p><p>Big Mac hummed. “Yeah? Who is it?” </p><p>“Rarity Belle. The high-falutin gal that liked dresses ‘n fru-fru things.” </p><p>Mac tapped his chin. “Huh. Imagine that. Didn’t think you’d want ta hang out with her.” </p><p>Applejack blushed and twirled a strand of her hair. “Me neither… at least, initially. She’s the best chance I’ve got right now fer makin’ friends ‘n stuff. What?! Did Ah say somethin’ weird? We might not like the same things but she’s friendly enough and likes ta talk.” </p><p>Mac chuckled. “Nice ta see ya git excited over the prospect o’ makin’ friends.” </p><p>“Yeah, well… like Ah told ya the other day, mah life is do fer a change. Nothin’ is gonna happen if Ah stay holed up on the farm all the time. Gotta grab the bull by the horns.” </p><p>The ginger-haired giant stepped out of the way with a bow and a flourish. “Go on then, sister. Don’t let me stand in the way o’ progress.”</p><p>Applejack rolled her eyes while she ascended the stairs to her room. “Hmph! Ya nosy galoot. Half tempted ta call Cheerilee and have her surprise ya with a visit. Maybe Rarity would know her phone number. Ah can just imagine the stupefied look on yer face if she showed up. HA!”</p><p>A quick glance at the clock informed the blonde farmer that she had just over an hour before the anticipated café date with Rarity. She gave herself a quick sniff and decided that taking a shower beforehand wasn’t necessary. Instead, she padded over to the bathroom and applied some generic deodorant underneath her armpits and sprayed a few puffs of rose-oil perfume around her wrists, neck, and lady bits. Applejack hated wearing cosmetics just as much as she hated wearing clothes but valued skin-care and personal hygiene to a near religious degree. Like Apple Bloom has mentioned earlier, you only had one body and it needed to be taken care of properly. </p><p>“Hmm. Should I do somethin’ with mah hair? Mah usual ponytail is fine Ah guess, but Ah don’t want her ta get the impression that Ah don’t care ‘bout the way Ah look.” </p><p>It took about ten minutes in front of the bathroom mirror, but Applejack managed to arrange her hair into a cute set of pigtails that were braided on both ends and held together by a pair of red scrunchies. For a brief moment, she contemplated if wearing her trusty Stetson in a café was appropriate and decided that she’d forgo doing so. Upon slathering her tan, freckled skin (<i>every nook and cranny</i>) with a little more cocoa-butter cream, she sighed to herself. Getting dressed was, unfortunately, part of the deal when a naturist ventured out into the public. </p><p>With a great deal of reluctance, Applejack rummaged through her drawers and found a clean pair of undergarments. Just a pair of plain, green cotton panties and a matching sports bra. Pretty much the kind one might find at a retailer that came in plastic packs. Nothing fancy or sexy. One hundred percent practical for the sole purpose of remaining modest when she was away from Sweet Apple Acres or at other social gatherings. Then came the flannel shirt, which she rolled up the sleeves to her elbows. And finally, a pair of jean shorts and sneakers. </p><p>Applejack stood in front of the mirror and appraised herself. “Reckon this’ll have ta be good enough fer Rarity. It’s not like I’ve got fancier duds tucked away somewhere else…”   </p><p>When she descended the stairs once more, Granny shot her an encouraging smile from where she was in the kitchen. The elder Apple was currently cooking some stew. “Ah know those danged things can’t be comfortable but keep yer chin up, sugarcube.”</p><p>Applejack gave her grandmother a quick kiss to the cheek. “I’ll try. Welp, here Ah go. Not sure when I’ll be back. If I’m out after supper is ready, then—”</p><p>“Hush, child,” Granny admonished while she gave her granddaughter a playful swat to the behind, “Git yer freckled fanny out the door and have fun! I’ll save ya some leftover stew n’ biscuits fer supper. Go on, now! Can’t have ya run late fer yer little date.”</p><p>Applejack blushed profusely at the implication. “It’s not—I’m—UGH! Fine. I’m goin’.” </p><hr/><p>The Mean Bean Café was Ponyville’s premier coffee shop for anyone with a discerning taste for a good ole cup of joe. A longtime fan of the caffeinated beverage herself, Applejack could appreciate a quality product when she saw one. In fact, she recognized some of the blends as having come from suppliers she’d done business with before. Rather than pay in custom, coffee bean growers tended to trade their stock for the Apple family’s famous cider or apple whiskey if it was the higher-grade stuff. Not huge amounts, but enough for a few month’s supply. </p><p>Since she was a little bit early, Applejack decided to order her drink while she waited for Rarity to show up. Most of the stuff on the menu were those fancy coffee drinks that had more in common with a milkshake than the simple beverage Applejack preferred slurp down in the morning. In the end, she decided to order a plain latte and sit over by a table next to the window. </p><p>Just as she was about to take the first sip, Rarity arrived at two o’clock on the dot. With a sheepish wave, Applejack beckoned her over to the table. A moment later, when she was good and settled, Rarity ordered an espresso with a chocolate almond biscotti. Silence stretched between the two women for what felt like an eternity. Applejack wasn’t entirely sure how to strike up a conversation with the fashionista. Yet, she awkwardly trudged forward. </p><p>“Howdy. Been a while since Ah last saw ya, Rarity.”</p><p>Rarity clapped her hands together. “Indeed, it has, darling! I must admit, I was surprised when Sweetie Belle told me that she’d visited your family’s farm. You must understand that while my little sister can be a bit rambunctious at times, she’s not a big fan of the outdoors.”  </p><p>Applejack began to lose her temper. “Ah dunno what yer preconceived notions of a farm are, but it ain’t a wild jungle. We keep things tidy and the farmhouse might be a tad rustic but everythin’ is in workin’ order. Ya tryin’ ta insinuate that we’re just a bunch o’ shabby rednecks?” </p><p>Rarity looked as though she bitten into a very bitter lemon peel. “No! Of course, not! Perish the thought, dear. It’s just that swimming in a pond isn’t something I would expect her to do is all. Although, come to think of it, she did mention wanting to try out her new bathing suit…” </p><p>“Well, there ya have it. And fer the record, she looked mighty cute in that frilly little thing.” </p><p>Rarity giggled snorted. “I should certainly hope so. I was the one who designed it.”</p><p>“Uh… come again?” </p><p>“Just because I’m only eighteen, doesn’t mean that I can’t design my own apparel.”</p><p>Applejack took a swig of her latte. “It ain’t that. I’m impressed.” </p><p>Rarity waved her hand. “I appreciate the compliment but I don’t believe it’s any different than how you’ve become skilled at your own craft over the years. Am I wrong to assume so?” </p><p>“Nah, yer right. Farmin’ ain’t as easy as some folks make it out ta be.” </p><p>“Indeed,” Rarity concurred, “The Apple Family is well known for their marvelous spirits.” </p><p>Applejack didn’t respond verbally. Instead, she was content to nod. </p><p>When she didn’t say anything else, Rarity coughed loudly and twiddled her fingers. “Please pardon my frankness but there’s something else I’ve been meaning to ask you. It’s a detail that Sweetie mentioned that I had a hard time believing. Would you mind confirming it?”</p><p>Applejack shut her eyes and groaned. “Ah already know what that particular detail is. The answer is yes. The Apple family have been naturists fer generations and we tend not ta wear a stitch o’ clothin’ all year around. All day long and even when we go ta bed. The Acres is private property by the way. We are legally allowed ta do as we please.”  </p><p>Rarity blushed slightly. “So, she was telling the truth, after all. My sincerest apologies, darling. I hadn’t meant to bring your… unique lifestyle choices under scrutiny. During high school, there were rumors about your family, but I never thought there was any substance to them.”</p><p>Applejack sighed. “Yeah, well… Ah tried mah damnedest ta make sure that everyone kept their traps shut about mah private life. In turn, Ah minded mah own business and didn’t say anythin’ ‘bout it either. Had a bad experience back in grade school when one o’ mah friends freaked out on account o’ me bein’ a naturist. She thought Ah was some kind o’ perverted freak.” </p><p>Rarity reached over and patted Applejack’s hand. “I’m terribly sorry to hear that, darling.” </p><p>“It’s in the past now. Ah wanna move on with mah life. Part o’ that process is comin’ ta terms with who Ah am and bein’ honest ‘bout the way Ah live. Ah also—uh—wanted ta make some more friends while Ah was at it too. That doesn’t sound too strange, does it?” </p><p>Rarity shook her head. “Not at all. I think it takes quite a bit of courage to admit that you want to change, Applejack. As for me, I don’t have anything against naturists. I mean, sure, the thought of people living in the nude is strange to me but so long as it doesn’t harm anyone, I’m all for it!”</p><p>“Yer more open-minded than most folks, Ah reckon.” </p><p>Rarity beamed with pride. “I’ll take that as a compliment~ In any case, if it’s a friend you’re looking for, I’d be more than happy to rekindle our old, high school comradery. And perhaps, deepen it too. Many of the girls left to go their separate ways. It would be nice to have another friend close-by to chat with and go out on all sorts of fun excursions.” </p><p>Applejack chuckled and rubbed the back of her neck. “Well, shucks. I’m flattered that you’re willin’ ta be mah friend on such short notice. Is there anythin’ Ah can do ta—”</p><p>Rarity waggled her finger. “Applejack, darling. Friendship should never be conditional. Furthermore, I’d hardly consider your suggestion ‘<i>on short notice</i>’. We’ve known each other for years. Although, in retrospect, I really should’ve made more of an attempt to become better acquainted without before now. Oh well~ Such is life, I suppose.” </p><p>“Don’t blame yerself, Rares. Heh. Do ya mind if Ah call ya that? Anyway… fer the longest time, I distanced mahself from everyone because Ah was afraid o’ bein’ shunned and ridiculed. The pain was too much fer me ta bear. That’s why Ah clammed up like a stubborn oyster durin’ harvestin’ season. I’m just glad that Apple Bloom decided not ta take the same route Ah did.” </p><p>Rarity offered a sympathetic smile. “My little sister speaks highly of her. You should be proud.” </p><p>“Darn tootin’ Ah am. Alright. Enough o’ this mushy stuff. Ya don’t want me blatherin’ on ‘bout all the sob stories in mah life. Let’s talk ‘about somethin’ more interestin’.” </p><p>Rarity placed her hand on Applejack’s arm and brushed it in a supportive gesture. “For what it’s worth, I’m sorry that you had to put up with all that pain and rejection. I cannot say that I truly understand what you went through all those years, but I shall try my best to empathize.”</p><p>“That’s about all Ah could ask fer.” </p><p>After nibbling on her biscotti, Rarity leaned back in her chair. “Sweetie mentioned something else about you that sparked my interest. I’m not sure what your aspirations are concerning higher education, considering that you have a farm to run but I plan on attending Canterlot University during the fall semester. For fashion design, of course!” </p><p>“Uh huh. And yer point is?” </p><p>Rarity cleared her throat. “My point, darling, is that Canterlot University is known for having an exceptional arts program. The department is well-funded and has top of the line facilities. You see, Sweetie mentioned that you might be interested in modeling. From what I understand, the school pays its models quite handsomely. Would such an arrangement interest you?” </p><p>Applejack shifted uncomfortably in her chair. “Well, Ah was thinkin’ ‘bout attendin’ university mahself durin’ the fall. Fer business and management, most likely. Ah got most o’ the knowhow Ah need from runnin’ the farm all these years, but it wouldn’t hurt ta git a proper degree.”</p><p>“Naturally. I too gained a bit of practical experience from designing my own clothes.” </p><p>Applejack peered into her half-empty coffee cup. “Ta answer yer other question, Ah ain’t real keen on modelin’ clothes and the like. There’s plenty o’ other gals more suited ta it than me.” </p><p>Rarity chortled. “I’m not talking about being a fashion model, dear. I meant nude modeling. Since you’re already a naturist, I can’t imagine it would be much of a stretch to take your clothes off in front of a group of art students and pose, would it?”</p><p>“Well, Ah suppose not…” </p><p>Rarity frowned. “I sense that you’re not entirely comfortable with the idea. What’s wrong?” </p><p>Applejack played with one of her pigtails. “Bein’ nude around people is one thing, Rares. Ah don’t have a problem with the way mah body looks. I’m comfortable with it. It’s just that—erm—Ah dunno if folks would want a muscled-up tomboy like me ta model for ‘em.”</p><p>“Don’t sell yourself short, Applejack. You might not look like a stereotypical fashion model, but I can tell that you have a beautiful, golden-brown complexion and a healthy physique to match. Even with your—ah—<i>rustic</i> attire obscuring the view, so to speak.”</p><p>Applejack blushed slightly at the praise but nodded. “Ah don’t really wear make-up either.” </p><p>“I don’t believe that shall be a problem. You’re a natural, blonde-haired beauty, Applejack. People tend to appreciate that more than you know. Would you at least consider modeling? You don’t have to give me an immediate answer, but I do have a few connections in the department. I’ll make sure that you’re given the respect you deserve and compensated generously.” </p><p>Applejack bit her lip. “Alright. I’ll consider it. Just don’t git yer hopes up and then have ‘em dashed if Ah say no. Maybe we could meet up at school once the new semester starts? Uh—at the very least, Ah mean. I’d still be partial to chattin’ with ya durin’ the summer too.” </p><p>Rarity clapped her hands excitedly. “That sounds like a splendid idea~ In the meantime, I can ask around my own group of friends and see if any of them would be willing to meet you. That is one of your goals, is it not? To make more friends…” </p><p>“Sure, it is. Heh. Ya know, if it ain’t too much trouble.” </p><p>“Not at all, darling! Nothing a simple text message can’t fix. I just want to make sure that you’re comfortable with me sharing your personal phone number. Don’t worry; I shan’t share it with any nefarious characters. <b>NOT</b> that I would associate with such scoundrels in the first place.” </p><p>Applejack chuckled. “I’ll—um—take yer word fer it.” </p><p>The remainder of their “<i>date</i>” was spent catching up on the old days and all the things that had changed with their lives since graduation. Given that it was just the beginning of summer, there wasn’t much to say in that regard but Applejack had never really paid much attention to Rarity’s business in the first place, so it was enlightening to hear what she was interested in. </p><p>For her part, Applejack tried to keep the conversation interesting but she knew that the daily life of a naturist farmer wasn’t exactly the most exciting topic to broach. Even so, Rarity was polite and asked questions throughout. When the two women finally parted ways, Applejack felt a warmth blossom in her chest that she hadn’t experienced in years. She felt a little silly for laughing to herself while she walked down the dirt road towards Sweet Apple Acres but it was cathartic. Applejack had finally made a friend who’d accepted her for who she was. </p><hr/><p>When Sweetie Belle suggested that they all go out to the mall shopping, Apple Bloom hadn’t set any expectations as to what they would actually do when they got there. To say that she was unenthused about browsing around for clothing and jewelry was the understatement of the century. With the exception of school and the occasional errand in town, Apple Bloom preferred lounging around in nothing more than her birthday suit instead of being forced to wear something (<i>no matter how comfortable</i>) just to comply with society’s stupid rules.  </p><p>Scootaloo hadn’t been very excited about window shopping either. Ever the sports-obsessed tomboy that she was, soccer balls and the newest cleats were more down her alley. Yet, they’d both silently agreed that the main reason for the trip was to appease Sweetie and try to have a good time with their friend despite their mutual dislike of girly things. The silver lining during their trip was that the mall had a decent food court to hang out in. Scootaloo &amp; Apple Bloom took full advantage of it whenever Sweetie wanted to shop at a store they didn’t. </p><p>After about an hour, Sweetie Belle realized that her friends were bored out of their minds and decided to cut her losses and join them for some bubble tea at the food court. They stayed, chatted, and ate a snack together until Scootaloo got a text from Rainbow Dash. Apparently, the rainbow-haired soccer fanatic had just bought a new drone and wanted to test it out with her honorary little sister. Unable to pass up such an awesome opportunity, Scootaloo said goodbye to her friends and rushed out the doors like the building was on fire. </p><p>Apple Bloom understood Scootaloo’s enthusiasm, but it was still very rude to ditch Sweetie Belle like that. The disappointed look on the curly-haired teenager’s face said it all. A warm hug ensured that she didn’t burst into tears, but Apple Bloom still felt guilty for making Sweetie think that hanging out at the mall had been a bad idea. As a token of her appreciation and friendship, Sweetie gave Apple Bloom a silver bracelet with colorful farm animal charms.  </p><p>Sweetie informed Apple Bloom that it’d been her intention all long to give her the bracelet as a gift at some point in the future, but decided that Apple Bloom should have it sooner rather than later. While touched by the gesture of generosity, the red-head wasn’t sure if the bracelet was safe to wear during her chores. The thing was kind of loose and had lots of little parts that could easily snag on equipment. Nonetheless, Apple Bloom thanked her friend and promised that she’d return the gift in kind someday. </p><p>Currently, Apple Bloom was back home and lying in the grass next to Winona. “Can ya understand why Ah felt so bad, girl? But at least Ah had the sense ta stay and cheer up Sweetie. Dang it! Scoots can be such a bone head sometimes. She probably doesn’t even feel guilty ‘bout the whole thing. Only cares ‘bout doin’ awesome stuff with Rainbow Dash.” </p><p>The border collie let out a soft bark and licked Apple Bloom’s cheek. </p><p>“I’ll text Sweetie later and ask her if she’s doin’ ok.”</p><p>Apple Bloom sat up when she saw a white sedan pull up the entrance of Sweet Apple Acres. As if on cue, Winona started barking and ran towards the car at full speed. A moment later, the driver of the vehicle stepped out and greeted the border collie with affection and a doggie treat. She was tall, dark-skinned, and had long, black &amp; white striped hair. A set of gold bangles graced her wrists with matching earrings up top. The middle-aged woman wore a simple, traditional, Zebrican dress and an accompanying pair of sandals. Without a shred of hesitation, Apple Bloom ran over to her and wrapped the woman in a bone-crushing hug. </p><p>“Auntie Z! It’s been so long since Ah last saw ya. How’re ya doin’?” </p><p>Zecora gave her honorary adoptive niece an affectionate kiss on the forehead. “I am doing well, thank you. You are growing up to be a fine young woman, Apple Bloom. Eating your Wheaties as they say?” </p><p>Apple Bloom scoffed. “Honest work will do that to ya. Not that Ah ain’t grateful fer the visit, but why’d ya stop by fer a visit today?” </p><p>“I require a sample of your bumper crop for my latest experiment. That and I figured I might as well purchase some apple whiskey while I was here. If it is not too much to ask…” </p><p>Apple Bloom smiled from ear to ear. “Sure thing, Auntie Z! Say, if yer gonna be here fer a while, ya might as well loose the duds and get comfy. Ah think there’s still some leftover pie in the fridge if ya want a slice. Some lemonade too. C’mon!” </p><p>Zecora laughed while she disrobed and placed her clothing into the backseat of the sedan. “It is a nice day outside, after all. Best not to waste the opportunity. Not to mention Apple Family hospitality. Very well then. We shall discuss business matters later.” </p><p>Having been born in a remote village near the southern region of Zebrica, Zecora’s ancestral homeland was known for upholding their traditional customs and way of life. One of which was that her people wore little to no clothing most of the time because the weather was so hot and arid all year long. They did not have the same taboos against nudity as many other modern nations did simply because it wasn’t practical for them to wear clothing in the first place.</p><p>Suffice to say, Zecora felt right at home whenever she visited Sweet Apple Acres and had no issue with the Apples being naturists. As for her purpose visiting the farm, she worked as the lead botanist for Canterlot University. Her research, at times, demanded plant samples and the crops grown by the Apple Family were some of the hardiest she’d ever come across during her seventeen-year long career. Despite her professional motives, Zecora was more than happy to make friends with the family and accept young Apple Bloom as one of her own. </p><p>For a woman in her early forties, Zecora looked exceptionally hale for her age. If a bit on the curvaceous side. Ample breasts, wide hips, and a round derriere made her the subject of envy amongst the Canterlot University staff. She didn’t do anything special to maintain her figure beyond regular exercise and a reasonably healthy diet. Zecora was quite comfortable in her own skin but didn’t appreciate the jealous stares of other women simply for being who she was. </p><p>At least she didn’t have to contend with their criticism over how she chose to style her hair. And no, not the stuff growing atop her head. Another tradition that Zecora held dear to her heart was that of genital ornamentation. Not so much in the way of piercings, although some tribespeople did get those on occasion. Rather, men and women alike grew out their pubic hair into neatly groomed strands, braided, then decorated them with beads of semi-precious stones. Zecora was partial to turquoise and decorated her own with beads of that color. It was both an expression of individuality and a symbol of adulthood in her culture. </p><p>While Apple Bloom got out a slice of pie, Zecora took a seat at the kitchen table. “I’ve been thinkin’. When do ya think mah fuzz is gonna be long enough ta braid like yours?” </p><p>“Hmm. I cannot say for certain, dearest niece. Your womanly mane is growing steadily as it should but such things are not meant to be rushed, nor should the decision to braid your hair be taken lightly. However, if your mind is set upon this course of action, please let me know what kind of beads you desire to use.” </p><p>Apple Bloom blushed and glanced down below her waist. “Yer beads look real pretty, Auntie Z. Ah just figured that maybe they’d look pretty on me too. When the time is right, o’ course.”  </p><p>Zecora laughed and patted her head. “Thank you, Apple Bloom. It means a lot to me that you have embraced my people’s traditions with such open-mindedness. If only others shared your enthusiasm. Forgive me if I sound fatigued. Work has been exhausting as of late.” </p><p>“How’s come?” </p><p>Zecora let out a tired sigh after taking a swig of lemonade. “The research department is pushing us to create a new breed of apples that are designed to thrive in less than ideal climates. To make matters worse, my nephew has decided to stay with me while he attends his first semester at Canterlot University. I am to oversee his major, as he is applying for a botany degree.” </p><p>Apple Bloom gasped in surprise. “Hold on a gosh-darned minute, Auntie Z! Ya have an actual nephew? When were ya plannin’ on tellin’ me that?” </p><p>Zecora frowned. “It was not my intention to mislead you, Apple Bloom. Rather, I did not believe such information was relevant to you. My brother moved to this country around fifteen years ago and married. My nephew, Hakizimana, was born here and does not appreciate the old ways as I do. Over the years, I have tried to teach him, but he does not seem interested in learning them.”</p><p>Apple Bloom placed her hand on Zecora’s shoulder and gave it a gentle squeeze. “I’m sorry ta hear that, Aunty Z. Everythin’ you’ve taught me ‘bout Zebrica always seemed so fascinatin’ and exotic. Maybe he’ll come ‘round later when he gits older or somethin’.”</p><p>The dark-skinned woman got out of her seat, gave Apple Bloom a hug, and ruffled her hair. “That remains to be seen, I am afraid. However, I have always appreciated your enthusiasm. At least I have passed on my knowledge to someone who has shown respect for the old ways.” </p><p>While they broke their embrace, Big Mac came plodding into the kitchen. Judging by the sheen of sweat covering his bronzed skin, the elder brother had been outside working for most of the day. After scratching his balls absentmindedly, Mac opened the fridge and grabbed the water pitcher so that he could pour himself a big glass. Only after he finished chugging, did he realize that Zecora was in the room, along with his little sister. Mac froze in place briefly and offered the two of them a sheepish chuckle.</p><p>“Howdy, Zecora. Didn’t realize ya came over fer a visit today. You’ll—uh—have ta forgive me fer not givin’ ya a hug. Afraid I’m all sweaty at the moment from choppin’ wood and haven’t gotten the chance ta take a shower yet. Beg yer pardon.” </p><p>Zecora offered him a polite smile. “Good Afternoon to you, Macintosh. I was just discussing a few things with Apple Bloom before we get down to business. I am in need of some apple seeds and a cask of your finest apple whiskey. Would you be willing to indulge my request?”</p><p>“Don’t see why not. We got plenty ta spare. ‘Bloom, why don’t ya take her out ta the stills and git everythin’ sorted out. I’d do it mahself but… ya know, tired n’ ripe.”</p><p>Zecora laughed melodically. “Believe me; I have smelled far worse than the likes of an honest day’s worth of sweat.”  </p><p>Mac’s entire face turned beet red. “Maybe so, but Ah don’t like bein’ stinky ‘round womenfolk.”</p><p>Apple Bloom rolled her eyes and took hold of Zecora’s hand. “Don’t mind that big goofus. He’s just sensitive ‘bout his body odor. It really ain’t that bad ta be honest. Then again, I’m probably not the best person ta ask, considerin’ that I live with him all the time.” </p><p>Zecora gave her a non-committal shrug while they walked towards the still room.  </p><p>“Say… ya ain’t sweet on mah brother, are ya? The way ya acted ‘round him seemed a tad—”</p><p>Zecora tapped her chin. “No, I am not. While handsome, he is a little bit too young for me. However, I have been known to be mischievous and enjoy teasing others on occasion.”</p><p>“Figures. Ya just wanted ta see him blush.” Apple Bloom intoned. </p><p>“Indeed. It was quite amusing to see him turn that lovely shade of pink~” </p><p>Apple Bloom let out a quiet sigh of relief. While she wouldn’t have voiced her objections if Zecora was genuinely interested in her brother <i>THAT</i> way, it could have made things so much more awkward around the farm when she came over to visit. In Apple Bloom’s humble opinion, being her honorary niece was good enough. With that out of the way, the teenager went about finding a good bottle of apple whiskey. Red Label, of course. Only the highest quality for family. </p><p>Rather than bother with a pre-packaged bag of seeds, Apple Boom decided that it was easier to just pick a few apples directly off of a tree. As an added bonus, the fruits could be enjoyed before the seeds were harvested for further experimentation. </p><p>Zecora placed the plastic bag full of liquor and fresh apples into the sedan and put her dress back on. “I wish that I did not have to wear this on the way home, but I cannot take the risk.”</p><p>“Yeah. Ah know the feelin’. In any case, I’m glad ya decided ta stop by today. It was fun catchin’ up with ya, Aunty Z. Don’t be a stranger, now. Come on by anytime ya want.” </p><p>Zecora bent down and gave Apple Bloom one final kiss to the cheek. “As always, it was a pleasure seeing you, Apple Bloom. Should you be interested in learning more about botany or Zebrican traditions, I am but a phone call away!” </p><p>Apple Bloom waved goodbye as Zecora’s care drove down the dirt road towards the expressway. An errant thought crossed her mind as she walked back to the farmhouse. Wasn’t Canterlot University the school Applejack was thinking about going to? It might very well be possible that Applejack could run into Zecora or even her nephew at some point. With a shrug, Apple Bloom decided it wasn’t worth worrying about. After all, she wasn’t the one going to college.</p>
