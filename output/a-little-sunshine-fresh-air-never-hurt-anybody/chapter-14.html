		<h1>Apple Bloom&#039;s Cousin Can&#039;t Be This Cute!</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 14</b></p><p>Egremont Russet High School, Ponyville </p><p>The lunch bell rang throughout the halls of ERHS as a throng of teenagers migrated towards the cafeteria. Apple Bloom waited patiently by her locker until Babs arrived, as this was her first week attending high school in Ponyville. Thankfully, Johnny Apple Seed had thought far enough ahead to name himself as her legal guardian before they officially moved to Sweet Apple Acres. Subsequently, he’d filled out all the necessary enrollment paperwork for his little sister about three weeks prior. It made the transition a little bit smoother for Babs, but the process was not without a few bumps along the way. Life in Manehattan had already been rough enough for the aspiring martial artist, and Apple Bloom was determined to do everything in her power to help smooth things out for her elder cousin no matter the circumstances. </p><p>Whenever Babs bothered to put clothes on (<i>the same could be said of Apple Bloom</i>), she tended to wear comfortable sneakers, a graphic t-shirt, and a frilled, navy-blue jean skirt. Before they left the house on Babs’ first day, Apple Bloom warned her cousin against going commando, as it was considered a gross violation of the school dress code and could land her in serious trouble. Begrudgingly, Babs agreed to wear undergarments, but she still had a habit of sitting like a guy. Not that anyone called her out on it. Many of her fellow classmates felt intimidated by her. </p><p>Apple Bloom sighed to herself. It was going to take time for everyone to understand that Babs was a kind and gentle soul once you got to know her better. However, teenagers, like their adult counterparts, tended to judge people based on how they looked at first glance. With her piercings, muscled limbs, and gruff demeanor, many of the students probably assumed she was some streetwise hoodlum from Manehattan, who would beat them up for their lunch money. </p><p>Nothing could be further from the truth. At least the teachers had come to recognize her academic prowess. It also helped that she’d been polite and respectful towards them. Apple Bloom hoped that they’d try to set things right, but it was a longshot at best. School staff took a hands-off approach when it came to student interaction, unless bullying was involved. Even then, they were often slow to act on verbal complaints alone, barring hard evidence to back them up.</p><p>Babs finally arrived with a bored expression on her face. She yawned briefly and lifted her shirt in order to scratch her stomach. “No offense, Bloom but—erm—these classes ain’t exactly challenging ta me. The school counselor should consider puttin’ me in the AP courses.”  </p><p>“We’ll cross that bridge when we git there. You’ve only been here fer a few days.” </p><p>Babs shrugged. “Fair enough. I’m starvin’. What’s for lunch today?” </p><p>“Meatloaf Ah think. If ya wanna call it that. I’d stick with the sammiches, personally.” </p><p>Babs held her cousin’s hand as they walked towards the cafeteria doors. “Guess I should’ve packed my lunch like you. Did ya whip that up yourself or…” </p><p>Apple Bloom chuckled. “Ah ain’t bad at cookin’, but AJ insists on packin’ mah lunch.” </p><p>“That’s awful sweet of her. My pops couldn’t be bothered to do anything like that for me. Johnny would give me money to buy food though. He’s… not a very good cook. Heh.” </p><p>Apple Bloom frowned. “Sorry, Ah didn’t mean ta bring up bad memories.” </p><p>“Don’t sweat it, cuz. I’ve already moved on. Hmm. Suppose I could try the turkey club.”</p><p>At their usual spot, Sweetie and Scootaloo were already seated, enjoying their respective lunches, chatting amongst themselves. Apple Bloom joined them while Babs went to go buy her lunch, whatever it might be that day. As soon as Apple Bloom unzipped her lunchbox, her BBFs stopped talking and focused their attention on her. While she set her thermos full of homemade ham &amp; bean soup on the table top, the redheaded teen began to feel awkward, unsure of what to say to her friends. Before she had the chance to speak, Babs came back with a tray full of BBQ chips, a turkey club, and a carton of whole milk. She sat directly across from Scootaloo. </p><p>“Hey, Babs. How’s your first week going so far?” Sweetie asked hesitantly. </p><p>“Eh. Not too bad, I guess. The kids around here seem awfully skittish though.” </p><p>Scootaloo slurped on her juice box. “I wouldn’t worry about them too much. They don’t know you like we do. Just give it some time, Babs. They’ll find out how awesome you are!” </p><p>Babs took a single bite of her sandwich and chewed on it slowly. “If you say so. Is it ‘cause of the way I look? Should I—uh—try ta act and dress up a bit more girly… maybe? I’m not stupid, Scoots. I’ve noticed how all the kids have been avoiding me. They think I’m gonna beat the shit outta them if they so much as look at me the wrong way. It ain’t fair! I’m not like that!”</p><p>Apple Bloom reached over and rubbed her back. “We’ll figure somethin’ out. Ah promise. At the very least, we can all hang out at the Acres after school n’ have some fun. How’s that sound?”</p><p>Sweetie raised her hand. “Sorry, girls. But I already promised Dinky and Button that we’d go raiding this afternoon. I’m going to be able to hang out with you.”</p><p>Scootaloo rolled her eyes. “This again? Can’t you just do it some other time?” </p><p>“That’s not how MMOs work, Scoots. Loot drops only happen at certain times and—”</p><p>Scootaloo scoffed. “Ok, I get it. Go do your stupid dungeon raid with your nerdy boyfriend.” </p><p>Sweetie blushed. “<b>HE’S NOT MY BOYFRIEND</b>!! We just happen to like hanging out together and share a lot of the same interests. There’s no law saying that I can’t have platonic relationships with boys in high school. Besides, I’m not sure if he likes me that way…”</p><p>“All the more reason why y’all should start datin’. Ask him out.” Apple Bloom suggested. </p><p>Sweetie Belle grumbled, then began playing with a strand of her hair. “But I—that’s not—how things are supposed to work… are they? Rarity’s always telling me that a proper lady has to be patient and show restraint around men. I dunno if that approach would work with Button.”</p><p>Apple Bloom’s brow furrowed in confusion. “Sounds too complicated fer mah blood. Just come out and say what ya mean, Sweetie. It’ll save y’all a heap o’ time and frustration, Ah reckon.”</p><p>Sweetie nibbled on her chocolate chip cookie for a moment while she pondered. “Where’s the romance in that? No build up. No heartfelt gestures. Knowing my luck, he’d just grunt in agreement, treat me the same way he always has, and keep playing his video game. I don’t even know if he’s interested in real world girls… let alone a pudgy marshmallow like me.”</p><p>“Did you try and find Button’s porn stash? Best way to find out a dude’s kinks.” Babs asked. </p><p>Sweetie began to choke on a lump of half-chewed cookie. “I would never do that!!”</p><p>Babs shrugged. “Ya never know, Sweets. He might have a thing for curvy broads. If ya won’t do that, then try goin’ over ta his house without a bra next time. Flash him a peek of your fun bags, but not in an obvious way. Gauge his reaction and see if he gets all flustered n’ shit.”</p><p>Sensing the awkward tension in the air, Apple Bloom cleared her throat loudly. “Uh—Babs, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Ya gotta let Sweetie handle it her own way. That bein’ said, mah offer ta hang out at Sweet Apple Acres after school still stands. Care ta join us, Scoots?”</p><p>“S’not like I have anything else going on today. Sure. Why not?”</p><p>Babs grinned. “Sweet! I’ve been wantin’ ta catch up with ya but I haven’t gotten the chance, since we’ve all been so busy as of late. I was wondering if you’d like ta spar with me this afternoon. There’s plenty of room at the Acres to do that. Uh—if you ya want to, that is.”</p><p>A slight blush crept onto Scootaloo’s cheeks. “What kind of sparring exactly?” </p><p>Babs stretched her arms upwards and let out a short grunt. “Gotta keep in shape for my MMA regimen. You seem like a fit gal, so I figured you’d be my best option for a partner.” </p><p>“What about Apple Bloom? She’s in good shape.” </p><p>Apple Bloom shook her head. “Mah body got this way on account o’ workin’ on the farm. The kind o’ shape Babs is talkin’ ‘bout is from trainin’ n’ sports. Never been a fan o’ that stuff. C’mon, Scoots! This sounds right up yer alley. Don’t tell me yer afraid ta lose.” </p><p>Scootaloo rubbed the back of her neck. “That’s not how training works, AB. I’m game for tagging along, but you have to promise to go easy on me while we spar. MMA fighting isn’t exactly a passion of mine. I’d like to… avoid getting injured over something stupid.” </p><p>“Safety always comes first!” Babs exclaimed. </p><p>Scootaloo chuckled. “Good. So… I guess I’ll meet up with you guys after school then.” </p><p>Babs gave her a thumbs up. “Awesome! It’s a date! See ya later, Scoots.” </p><p>When Scootaloo was well out of ear shot of her friends, she walked over to her locker, blushed furiously and felt a peculiar sensation prickle all over her skin. “What the hell did I just agree to? Take in a deep breath, Scoots. It’s just a sparring session with an old friend. No reason to get all worked up. Damn it! After all this time, I thought I’d finally gotten over my crush on Babs, but it’s just as strong as it’s ever been. </p><p>“I never thought, in a million years, that she’d actually move to Ponyville and I’d get to see her on a regular basis. At the very least, I should pack some comfy sparring clothes. Yeah. Focus on the training, and not the gut-wrenching existential dread that threatens to consume your very being. Hehehe!”</p><hr/><p>Scootaloo swallowed a lump that had begun to form in her throat as the final bell rang and she closed her locker door shut. It took several years for her to process, but the tomboy had gradually come to realize that she was attracted to other girls. It was not an easy revelation to deal with as a teenager, seeing as how her two best friends in the entire world were not only cute, but one of them was a naturist. It took every ounce of Scootaloo’s willpower not to gawk at her friends while they were frolicking about in the nude. She was ashamed of herself for thinking about them in a lewd manner, but hormones had a funny way of messing with your mind and body.  </p><p>The sole person she’d ever admitted these ‘<i>taboo</i>’ feelings to was Rainbow Dash. It had been a long, awkward conversation, but in the end, Scootaloo did not regret having it. So far as Scootaloo could tell, RD seemed to like men and women equally, in terms of finding them attractive. It only served to make her own feelings on the matter all the more confusing. Her older sister’s advice had been straightforward: just be yourself. As if it were that simple! Not only did she have to contend with lingering body image issues (<i>the naked bonding time she’d shared with Sweetie &amp; Apple Bloom had helped a little) </i>but she was terrified that openly embracing her sexuality would only serve to strain her relationship with them.</p><p>Her thoughts eventually began to drift towards Babs again. Years had gone by since they last met in person. In that time, Scootaloo had to admit that her crush had filled out quite nicely. Her muscular physique was obvious, even when wearing a casual outfit at school. Lewd thoughts began to dance around Scootaloo’s mind as she imagined Babs wearing nothing but a cocky grin, inviting her to bed. To be embraced by those strong arms, to breathe in the scent of her raspberry locks, and held tight against her freckled, tawny skin was a fantasy that Scootaloo dared not pine for, lest it be shattered in an instant. </p><p>Scootaloo sighed to herself. “I’m not gonna get anywhere if I stay at my locker all afternoon. Alright, girl. You can do this! Just try to act cool and keep it casual. Don’t make things weird.” </p><p>As luck would have it, Apple Bloom’s brother was able to pick everyone up at the school parking lot. The three teenagers piled into the back seat of the family truck and headed down the road towards Sweet Apple Acres. Scootaloo didn’t say much on the drive over. It was a relatively short one, after all. Sitting in such close proximity to her crush had made the tomboy a nervous wreck. Intensified by the fact that she could smell lingering traces of the bodywash Babs had used earlier in the morning before school started. If she didn’t know any better, Scootaloo swore that it was the scent of men’s body wash, not the girly stuff Sweetie liked to lather herself with. </p><p>“Hey—um—you smell good today, Babs. Are you wearing perfume or something?” </p><p>The amateur fighter blew a strand of hair away from her eye. “Nah. Perfume ain’t my scene. Forgot ta grab my own body wash at the store, so I borrowed some of my brother’s. I think it’s called ‘<i>Timberwood</i>’ or some outdoorsy sounding shit. You like ta wear perfume, Scoots?”  </p><p>Scootaloo suddenly felt self-conscious about how she smelled. She lifted the collar of her shirt and gave her chest a quick sniff just to make sure her skin didn’t stink like stale sweat. Thankfully, it didn’t. Gym class had ended hours ago. “When the occasion calls for it. Sweetie introduced me to some pretty awe—er—I mean interesting scents. Ya know… like vanilla jasmine and rose petals. Nothing too expensive though! Honeysuckle is my favorite.”</p><p>“Oh. That’s cool. Johnny likes to wear cologne. Soap and shampoo usually do it for me.”</p><p>Apple Bloom cocked her brow. “Ah didn’t know ya liked wearin’ frou-frou perfume.” </p><p>Scootaloo’s cheeks flushed. “What’s wrong with liking the finer things in life?” </p><p>“Never said there was anythin’ wrong with it, Scoots. Just surprised is all. No offence, but ya don’t strike me as the type o’ person who’d enjoy doin’ things like that.” </p><p>Scootaloo crossed her arms and pouted. “I am <b>A GIRL</b>; in case you’ve forgotten…” </p><p>Apple Bloom sighed. “Right. Sorry if Ah ruffled yer feathers. Wasn’t mah intention.” </p><p>“It’s ok, AB. I’m in a weird mood today.” </p><p>“Wanna talk ‘bout it?” Apple Bloom offered. </p><p>Scootaloo hesitated for a moment, considering her options. In the end, she decided it was better if Apple Bloom remained ignorant of the “<i>I have a massive crush on your cousin</i>” problem. “Nah, I think I just need some fresh air and exercise after being cooped up at school all day.” </p><p>Babs cracked her knuckles in anticipation. “You’ve come ta the right place, Scoots! Nothin’ beats working up a good sweat and loosening up all your muscles. Then ya can take a cold shower right after. Or go for a swim in the pond. Couldn’t do that back in Manehattan.” </p><p>“Uh… right. I’ll stick to hot showers, thank you very much.” </p><p>The girls shared a laugh as Mac pulled into the barn. As they piled out of the truck, Mac waved goodbye to them and made his way back to the stills. In the meantime, Apple Bloom beckoned Babs and Scootaloo to come with her to the second level of the farmhouse, where they could stow their backpacks and get more comfortable. Scootaloo followed Apple Bloom into her room, while Babs walked down the hall towards her own. </p><p>No sooner did her backpack hit the floor, Apple Bloom immediately began taking off her clothes. She was nude within a matter of moments. Suffice to say, it was <i>VERY</i> awkward standing right behind her best friend while she bent over to put a pair of shorts away in the bottom drawer of the dresser. Scootaloo kept her mind focused on changing into the extra set of workout clothes she’d packed. Unlike the last time she’d visited the farmstead, Apple Bloom hadn’t insisted that she follow the family dress code, or lack there of in this case. </p><p>In an effort to keep things simple, Scootaloo opted to wear an orange tank top with a matching pair of athletic shorts, and sneakers. The typical outfit she wore whenever training was involved. In the back of her mind, she wondered what Apple Bloom would be doing while she sparred with Babs. Probably nothing too intense, as she’d taken her shoes off. Then again, Scootaloo couldn’t recall a time when Apple Bloom wasn’t already walking around the place barefoot. In fact, none of the Apples seemed to wear shoes while they were at work or play. </p><p>“Say, AB. This is gonna sound like a weird question, but I’m curious.”</p><p>Apple Bloom was busy in the bathroom washing her face. “Go ahead. Ah don’t mind.” </p><p>“Do you guys ever wear shoes outside? Seems like a good way to hurt your feet…” </p><p>Apple Bloom stepped out of the bathroom and stretched her arms. “Most o’ the time, no. The soles o’ yer feet toughen up considerably when ya don’t wear shoes. If we’re doing heavy work, like wood chippin’ or haulin’ gravel, then yeah. Heck, we even wear clothes fer that. Personally, Ah find shoes n’ sandals ta be a might suffocatin’. Prefer ta feel the ground beneath mah feet.” </p><p>Scootaloo laughed. “You’re a naturist even when it comes to footwear!” </p><p>“What else did ya expect?” </p><p>Scootaloo performed her own set of stretches. “I dunno. Say, are you gonna join us for a sparring session? Not to be rude, but you aren’t exactly—uh—dressed for the part.” </p><p>Apple Bloom shook her head. “Ain’t mah cup o’ tea. Much prefer ta take a nap on the porch with Winona. Might go fer a swim later. Haven’t quite decided yet. Y’all should be fine without me.” </p><p>“Well, I did want to catch up with Babs. Since we don’t share that many classes together, I haven’t had the chance to hang out with her beyond lunch period. Even after school.”</p><p>Apple Bloom grinned. “There ya go! I’m gonna head out ta the porch. Holler if ya need me.” </p><p>With that, Apple Bloom took her leave and descended the stairs towards the kitchen where she could grab some lemonade. Scootaloo followed shortly thereafter, only to stop dead in her tracks. There, in the middle of the hallway, stood Babs in all her natural glory. The only thing she wore was a white towel wrapped around her neck. Scootaloo’s heart began to hammer in her chest, her palms became sweaty, and her mouth felt like it was stuffed full of cotton balls. </p><p>At no point had anyone mentioned that Babs Seed was a dedicated naturist like her cousin. In hindsight, it made perfect sense that other members of the Apple Family might be inclined towards the lifestyle, but Scootaloo had never connected the dots until the very moment she laid eyes on the tan-skinned goddess that stood before her. Without anything to cover her body, Babs’ muscular physique was a sight to behold. She was even sexier than Scootaloo had dared imagine. Not only that, she noted, but Babs had freckles everywhere you could imagine! </p><p>“Hey, Babs. Do you need a moment to get ready? I can wait…” </p><p>Babs walked towards Scootaloo and shot her a confused look. “Huh? Nah, I’m good ta go.”</p><p>As they descended the stairs together, Scootaloo had to force herself to look ahead and not stare at Babs’ perfectly chiseled buns. “I-I didn’t realize that you were a naturist like Apple Bloom.” </p><p>Babs chuckled. “Shit. I must’ve forgot ta tell everyone. Cat’s outta the bag now, I guess. Is me bein’ nude gonna make our sparring session weird? If so, I can throw somethin’ on.”</p><p>“That’s ok. I just wasn’t expecting the whole ‘<i>Ancient</i> <i>Greek Athlete</i>’ routine. Heh.” </p><p>Babs nodded in agreement. “Never thought of it that way. But you’re right, Scoots. Those guys did all of their training in the buff back then. I have ta say, it’s a helluva lot easier to move around without all those sweaty gym clothes bogging ya down. Plus, washing off is a breeze. Feel free ta take your clothes off too if ya want. Doesn’t bother me one bit.” </p><p>“I’m good, thanks.” Scootaloo squeaked. </p><p>It was a short walk to the barn from the farmhouse. Tucked away in the back corner was a punching bag and a few hand weights of various sizes. Not quite as fancy as the gym they had in town, but at least Babs didn’t have to worry about dues or following the dress code. She padded over to the wall and hung up her towel on a hook, then proceeded to do a few basic stretches. All the while, Scootaloo watched in awe as her friend flexed in ways that got the blood pumping, unsure what kind of regimen she had planned and if it would involve intimate, physical contact. </p><p>Babs turned her neck from side to side and groaned aloud. &quot;There we go. Nice and loose. Don’t wanna pull any muscles. Ya all set, Scoots? Didn’t see ya stretchin’ over there.” </p><p>“I did before while we were changing in Apple Bloom’s room.” Scootaloo mumbled. </p><p>“Cool. We’ll start with a few simple kicks, jabs, and punches. Ya look like you’re in pretty good shape, so I imagine that shouldn’t be too difficult, yeah? We can take turns on the bag. Gettin’ kicked or punched in the face fuckin’ sucks. Even if it’s by accident. Safety first!” </p><p>Scootaloo felt like her legs were made of spaghetti. “I’ll just… lift weights until my turn.” </p><p>Babs didn’t hesitate to get started. Within seconds, the constant <i>WHUMP WHUMP WHUMP</i> of the punching bag being struck filled the air. Scootaloo busied herself with the moderately sized weights and did some curls with them, but kept her eye on Babs. Her strikes were powerful and precise, made all the more magnificent because Scootaloo could see every muscle in motion down to the finest detail. Before long, a thin sheen of sweat had accumulated all over her friend’s body, making her tan skin glisten underneath the rays of sunlight that filtered through the barn. </p><p>Scootaloo blinked owlishly when the noises stopped. “Oh! Is it my turn already?” </p><p>“Sure. I gotta cool off for a sec. It’s kinda embarrassing, but I sweat like a pig.” </p><p>Blushing furiously, Scootaloo approached the bag and took a fighting stance. “Hahaha! No worries, Babs. I don’t mind a little sweat. Take your time. I’ll get started… I guess.”</p><p>After a few experimental kicks, Scootaloo felt like she wasn’t putting enough power behind her strikes. Not like Babs had. Feeling frustrated, the spikey-haired tomboy switched to punching and found that she was having the same problem. After watching her friend struggle for a little while longer, Babs decided to intervene and show Scootaloo how to kickbox the proper way. </p><p>Scootaloo yelped when she felt a pair of strong arms wrap around her waist. “Lemme show ya what you’re doin’ wrong. Ya gotta spread out your legs more. Huh. I never noticed before, but you’ve got some nice muscle tone going on. Track and field?” </p><p>“Soccer, actually.” She managed to blurt out. </p><p>“Ah. That would also explain your tight tummy n’ buns. Nice job on the conditioning.” </p><p>Scootaloo felt her skin flush cherry red. “Thanks, Babs. No one’s ever complimented me like that before. I was beginning to think that everyone saw me as nothing more than a scrawny tomboy. As you can see, I don’t exactly have a lot of sex appeal going for me.” </p><p>Babs cocked her head and frowned. “Really? What a shame. I don’t think that’s true at all. Every body is different. I meant that both ways. Clever, huh? So—uh—there’s nothin’ wrong with the way your body is built, Scoots. Ya just gotta… own it. Accept that you’re you and no one else.”  </p><p>Scootaloo giggled girlishly. She prayed that it didn’t make her sound stupid in front of Babs. “Is that some kind of Zen-Naturist quote you picked up from a book?”</p><p>For the first time all afternoon, Babs blushed. Her smile made Scootaloo’s heart beat faster. “Nah. We naturists like ta call that common sense. Or… at least, we think it should be.”</p><p>Distracted as she was, Scootaloo tripped over Babs’ foot when they shifted position, sending both girls tumbling onto the padded floor below. When she regained her senses, Scootaloo found herself face to face with her crush, just a hair away and pinned down by her arms. In fact, Babs was pressed up against her so close that she could feel the heat radiating from her friend’s skin, and the musky-sweet aroma of her sweat mixed with body wash filled Scootaloo’s nostrils. It was enough to make her want to faint on the spot, but she tried her best to keep a clear head. </p><p>Babs blushed even harder than before, rolled off to the side of the mat, and coughed. “Sorry! I-I guess I wasn’t payin’ attention ta where my feet were. Are ya ok? Does anything hurt?”</p><p>Scootaloo rubbed the back of her neck. “I think I’m fine. Nothing but a bruised ego.” </p><p>Babs slowly rose to her feet and checked her body for injuries. Once she was satisfied that there weren’t any scrapes or bruises, she grabbed the towel from the hook and wiped her face. “Shit on a brick. I went and made things weird, didn’t I? This was a bad idea. I should’ve—”</p><p>Scootaloo hesitantly reached out and took hold of Babs’ hand. “Please don’t blame yourself for what happened. I wasn’t paying attention either. It was both our fault! Look, I’m just not used to the whole ‘<i>hanging out with my naturist friends</i>’ thing yet. Not sure I ever will get used to it. Plus, being around you… like this is—erm—more than a little distracting, to be honest.”</p><p>“What exactly do ya mean by that, Scoots?”  </p><p>Scootaloo looked down at the floor and shuffled her feet. “Do I really have to say it out loud?” </p><p>“How else do ya expect me ta know? Just say what ya mean. I won’t get offended. Promise.” </p><p>“I think you’re super-hot.” Scootaloo replied, voice barely above a whisper. </p><p>Dumbfounded, Babs’ mouth gaped like a fish. “Hold on. Did I hear you right? You think I’m hot? As in, like, I’m a babe? Don’t fuck with me, Scoots. That’s just mean. I’m not—”</p><p>Cheeks flushed like a tomato, Scootaloo finally looked up. “<b>I’M NOT JOKING</b>!”</p><p>“Oh. So, this whole time…” </p><p>On the verge of tears, Scootaloo sniffed. “Yes. I’ve been ogling every nook and cranny of that stupid, sexy, muscly body of yours. There! I said it! Are you happy now, Babs?! I feel like a perverted creep who’s been taking advantage of her friend all afternoon. I can’t help it though!”</p><p>Unsure how to deal with an emotional tomboy, Babs shuffled her feet. “I suppose you’re right about that, Scoots. With me struttin’ around naked as a jaybird, you can’t help but see all the goods. I’m not upset though! In fact, I’m happy that you think my body is worth checkin’ out. A lot of hard work and effort went into sculptin’ all these muscles. I’m damn proud of them too!”</p><p>Scootaloo let out watery chuckle. “You should be. They’re awesome. I-I mean everything about you is awesome. What I’m trying to say is: I’ve… had a crush on you for a while. Even back when we were kids. I just didn’t know how to deal with my feelings. That was one of my biggest regrets up to this point. Now that I’ve confessed, I hope I didn’t make things weird between us.”</p><p>Babs plopped down on the mat and groaned out of frustration. Oblivious to her state of undress, the young fighter neglected to close the wide gap in-between her legs while she lifted her knees up towards her chest and wrapped her arms around them. Scootaloo made the mistake of directing her attention downwards at that precise moment, and wound up getting an eyeful of salmon pink—she quickly shook her head and redirected her focus on Babs’ face. </p><p>After a little awkward shuffling, Scootaloo took a seat next to her friend on the mat and carefully placed her hand on Babs’ back. It was warm, and slightly sweaty, but she could feel the powerful muscles just beneath the surface. She didn’t make any attempt to shy away from Scootaloo’s touch, so the spikey-haired tomboy kept her hand in place, hoping that she could somehow salvage the situation with her childhood crush. It took a few moments for Scootaloo to speak. </p><p>“So—erm—about my confession earlier. You’re the only other person, besides Rainbow Dash, that I’ve openly admitted to being gay. Nobody else knows about my preferences. Not even my aunts or Sweetie &amp; Apple Bloom. Damn it! Why is this so hard to talk about?! Look, Babs… I’d totally understand if you don’t feel the same way about me. I just had to tell you. I couldn’t keep these feelings bottled up forever. I hope we can still be friends.” </p><p>Babs reached over and placed her hand on Scootaloo’s thigh. “A brave thing ya did there, Scoots. Takes some serious <i>cajones</i> ta confess ta your crush. Especially, in a situation like this. Here’s the thing: I like girls too. But with everything goin’ on, I ain’t sure that I’m ready ta start a relationship. I’ve just barely begun ta get my life back on track. Does that make sense?” </p><p>Scootaloo frowned. “Yeah. I get it. You’ve been through a lot.” </p><p>Cheeks rosy pink, Babs cleared her throat. “Like I said before, it made me happy when you told me that I was hot. And—well—you’re not so bad lookin’ yourself. Out of all of Apple Bloom’s friends, you were always the easiest ta get along with. Back when we were kids, I felt like there was a connection between us. I dunno if I’d call it attraction, but somethin’ was there. Guess I better stop ramblin’ and get ta the point. Gimme a little time ta think it over.”</p><p>Scootaloo’s expression brightened. “Does that mean you’d like to go out with me?” </p><p>“I’m sayin’ that I might be open ta the possibility.” </p><p>Scootaloo’s heart felt a million times lighter. “Heh. At least that’s not a rejection.” </p><p>Sensing an opportunity, Babs scooted closer to her friend and placed her head upon Scootaloo’s shoulder. “This is gonna sound like an odd request, but could ya hold me for a while?”</p><p>“Uh… sure?”</p><p>Babs motioned for Scootaloo to lay down on the mat beside her, which she did, albeit hesitantly. Before she could voice any sort of protest, Babs wrapped her arms around Scootaloo’s back and embraced her like a lover would. Her hold was a little tighter than Scootaloo preferred, but it wasn’t the worst feeling in the world. In a matter of moments, Babs began sobbing quietly into Scootaloo’s shirt. A strange mixture of sadness and arousal swirled in Scootaloo’s mind as she ran her fingers through Babs’ hair. Her aunts had done the same for her whenever she was upset. After they stayed that way for a few minutes, Babs finally lifted her head, eyes red and puffy. </p><p>“Ever since I was a kid, I had ta be tough and self-sufficient. You’ve gotta be on the mean streets of Manehattan. But even gals like me need ta be held and told that everything is gonna be ok.”</p><p>Blushing furiously, Scootaloo bit her lip. “What about your brother? Doesn’t he ever hug you?” </p><p>“Not as much as he used ta. Especially, after I decided ta start living as a naturist.”</p><p>Scootaloo tensed up when she felt Babs nuzzle her breast. “It’s probably awkward for him.” </p><p>“Johnny tries real hard ta be supportive, but I know that our way of life makes him feel uncomfortable. You should’ve seen what happened during dinner the other day. He got flustered on account of AJ flashin’ her pussy at him. Not on purpose, mind you, but… I think he had a long talk with Mac about it afterwards. I’m just glad everyone wasn’t angry with him.” </p><p>Scootaloo sighed. “To be honest, I’m not accustomed to you guys being naturists either.”</p><p>Babs frowned. “Oh. I hope us cuddling like this isn’t too—erm—weird.” </p><p>“There are worse positions I could be in right now,” Scootaloo admitted with a goofy grin, “just don’t expect me to start ripping off my clothes anytime soon.”</p><p>Babs hummed. “Even so, I’d love ta see what ya really look like underneath those gym clothes sometime. Even if I have ta rip ‘em off myself.” </p><p>“Is that your way of flirting with me?” </p><p>Scootaloo let out a girlish squeak when Babs traced her fingers along the other girl’s bare thigh. “I meant what I said before, Scoots. You’ve got a beautiful body that shouldn’t be hidden away from the world. Maybe I could teach you a thing or two about confidence.”</p><p>“Your cousin already tried to convince me of that once before. For now, the clothes stay on.” </p><p>Babs let go of Scootaloo, stretched out her limbs, and grabbed the towel. “Could I at least convince you ta take a shower with me? We’ve both worked up a pretty good sweat.” </p><p>Scootaloo stood up as well, crossing her arms underneath her breasts. “I’m sorry, Babs. I just don’t think I’d be comfortable doing that with you if we’re not a couple. Being naked around your friends might not be a big deal to you, but I wouldn’t be able to keep my composure.”</p><p>“I’ve never been good at figurin’ out people’s boundaries. Hell, I haven’t tried dating anyone before either. Too much shit goin’ on at home for me ta worry about stuff like that. I figured that since you seemed ok with snugglin’ me, a shower wouldn’t be too much ta ask for.”</p><p>Scootaloo closed her eyes for a moment. “I only did that because you looked so desperate.”</p><p>“Is that how ya see me? Pitiful and desperate?!” Babs asked, anger flaring in her voice. </p><p>Scootaloo shook her head vehemently. “I didn’t mean it like that! You looked like you needed a shoulder to lean on. Rainbow Dash is always telling me that you have to be a good friend, even if that means sacrificing your own personal comfort in the process. Yeah, cuddling with you on the mat was super awkward for me, but I did it because I thought that’s what you needed most.”</p><p>The anger drained away in an instant. Babs let out a heavy sigh. “Seriously. Thanks for that, Scoots. I’m sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable. Can we just—I dunno—try ta hang out normally for the rest of the day? I think we ought ta get ta know each other better, at least.”</p><p>“We can certainly try,” Scootaloo conceded, “but calling this <i>normal</i> is a bit of a stretch.” </p><p>“Fair enough. Let’s hit the showers then. Uh—not together, of course.”</p><p>Scootaloo chuckled nervously. “Someday, maybe. Just not right now.” </p><p>The two teenagers left the barn, feeling a little bit more at ease than they had before. Babs politely offered to let Scootaloo use the shower inside, while she chose to bathe using the water pump beside the farmhouse. The water was ice cold, but Babs found it refreshing and it also helped clear her mind. By the time she was finished, Babs made her way over to the porch where Apple Bloom was still fast asleep in the rope hammock with Winona curled up beneath her feet. </p><p>Grinning impishly, Babs slid her hand underneath the hammock and goosed Apple Bloom with her thumb, causing the young farmer to flail around and shout out a string of expletives that would’ve made Granny Smith proud. When Apple Bloom realized that it was just Babs messing with her, she calmed down a little but was visibly upset at having been woken up in such a rude manner. Winona yawned, licked her chops, and watched the whole affair with stoic indifference. She was accustomed to seeing her mistresses behave like a bunch of overly-energetic puppies. </p><p>“Ya could’ve just tapped mah shoulder.” </p><p>Babs snicked. “Where’s the fun in that? C’mon, Apple Bloom. I didn’t poke ya that hard.” </p><p>Still grumbling, Apple Bloom stepped onto the porch and stretched out her limbs like a cat. “Whatever. Where’s Scoots? Ah thought she was supposed ta be sparrin’ with ya this afternoon.” </p><p>“We did spar for a little while. But then… things got really fuckin’ awkward and we stopped.” </p><p>Apple Bloom raised her brow. “What do ya mean by that, exactly?” </p><p>Babs blushed slightly and rubbed the back of her neck. “She apparently has a huge crush on me. Don’t gimme that look! I had no idea until today. I guess me bein’ nude didn’t help matters…” </p><p>Apple Bloom frowned. “Probably not. Scoots was a might skittish ‘bout takin’ her clothes off when Ah invited her and Sweetie over ta make up durin’ fall break. If her barn door swings in that direction, and Ah suspect it does, ya only added fuel ta the fire by givin’ her a peep show.” </p><p>Babs shuffled her feet. “It’s my fault. I should’ve told her that I was a naturist beforehand.”</p><p>“Water under the bridge now. Makes me wonder why Scoots didn’t tell us ‘bout bein’ gay before. Sweetie and Ah love her just as much as if she were our own kin. We’d never shun her on account of who she is, what she looks like, or the people she prefers ta go out on a date with.” </p><p>“Don’t be too hard on her, cuz. She’s confused and still tryin’ ta figure things out.”</p><p>Apple Bloom nodded in agreement. “We’ll just have ta be extra careful ‘bout discussin’ the subject when she’s willin’ ta come out openly. In the meantime, I’m concerned about what yer role is in this whole situation. Do ya like girls too? And more importantly, do ya fancy Scoots?” </p><p>Babs put her hands behind her head and blew out a heavy sigh. “Yeah, I’m a lesbian too. I’ve known that I like girls for a while and have accepted that part of myself. As for your other question, that’s not somethin’ I can give you a clear answer on. I dig Scoots as a friend, and I do think she’s cute but… I dunno if I’m ready ta start a romantic relationship with anyone just yet.” </p><p>“As honest an answer as any. Ah can accept that. <b>BUT</b>! Don’t string her along and be wishy-washy ‘bout her feelings for ya. At some point, yer gonna have ta make a choice, Babs.” </p><p>“Don’t worry; I will. I just need some more time ta figure out where my own life is goin’.”</p><hr/><p>Scootaloo joined the rest of the Apple Family at the dinner table, being one of only two people wearing any sort of clothing. It made her feel slightly less alienated, knowing that there was someone else living at Sweet Apple Acres who wasn’t a dedicated naturist. She sat down next to the young man, and he introduced himself as Johnny Apple-Seed, Babs’ oft talked about older brother. Now that she’d had the chance to see him in real life, the resemblance between the two siblings was uncanny. The only major difference was that Johnny had more of an average physique as opposed to an athletic one. Which made sense. He didn’t train everyday like his little sister. They began to converse amongst themselves while Granny went to fetch the main course. </p><p>The menu featured her famous Apple Family fried chicken. Cooked golden brown until crispy on the outside, and juicy on the inside. It was a recipe that had been handed down generation to generation, dating all the way back to the old country. As was tradition, the oldest daughter of each generation was taught the recipe and sworn to uphold its secrets until a new female member of the Apple Family was born. Applejack knew how to make it, but Granny was an old pro. </p><p>“Go on and dig in y’all. Biscuits n’ gravy will be out shortly.” Granny Smith advised. </p><p>Scootaloo bit into a drum she’d picked up from the plate and found her mouth swimming in a sea of delicious chicken goodness. “Holy crap! This is, like, the best fried chicken I’ve ever tasted!” </p><p>“Eeyup. It’s great-great grandpappy Egremont Russet Apple’s original recipe. From before our family emigrated from <i>Hӧckenstein-Am Mer</i>. That used ta be a sovereign principality in the Germaneian Empire back before the country became unified. They had ta leave, so they could avoid bein’ persecuted fer their lifestyle.” Applejack affirmed with a hint of pride. </p><p>Scootaloo furrowed her brows in confusion. “Hold on a second. Isn’t that the name of our high school? Are you trying to tell me that they named it after him?!” </p><p>“Sure did. As a matter o’ fact, the Apple Family founded Ponyville over 150 years ago. Heh. Well, erm—at least this branch. We’ve got kin all over the country. When they first built the school, the mayor decided it was appropriate ta honor our great-great grandpappy’s name.”</p><p>Scootaloo dipped a warm, buttery biscuit into her gravy bowl and began to chew on it. “How come they never taught us about that in school? Come to think of it, they don’t mention our town’s history at all in the textbooks. I figured it would be important, but I guess not.” </p><p>Granny scoffed. “Yer right, young-in. The Ponyville council’s hesitant ta broach the subject, on account o’ the fact that they’d have ta admit that their precious city was founded by a bunch o’ nekkid hillbillies. Imagine the stir it’d cause if they included pictures in the history books!” </p><p>“Do such pictures exist after all this time?” Scootaloo asked. </p><p>Granny nodded enthusiastically. “Darn tootin’ there is! Ah can show ya the scrapbook.” </p><p>“That’s ok. I don’t need to see them that badly…” </p><p>Granny took a sip of iced tea and shrugged. “No skin off mah nose. Johnny, you’ve been awfully quiet over there. Somethin’ the matter?” </p><p>“Nothing in particular, Granny. I’m just enjoying the food.” </p><p>“How’ve ya been adjustin’ ta yer new job?” </p><p>Johnny wiped his mouth with a napkin. “It’s goin’ pretty good so far. With Mac’s help, I think we might be able ta produce a new tangy apple variant of cider by the end of the year.” </p><p>Babs punched her brother’s arm playfully. “That’s great, bro!” </p><p>“Yeah. For once, I feel like things are finally starting to turn around for the better.” </p><p>Babs smiled from ear to ear, voice thick with emotion. “Same goes for me.” </p><p>Not wanting to interrupt such a tender family moment, Scootaloo waited a little while to speak again. Instead, stuffing her gullet with more fried chicken. Once she was finished, she cleared her throat. “Hey, Babs. Would it be ok if I came over here every once and while to train?” </p><p>“Sure. I don’t mind. But Granny has the final say, since she’s the head of the family.” </p><p>The Apple Family matriarch smiled. “Yer always welcome here, Scootaloo. As far as I’m concerned, yer practically Apple Bloom’s sister, along with yer other gal-pal, Sweetie Belle. Y’all can come over n’ visit whenever the mood strikes. Our door will be open.”  </p><p>“Thanks. I think spending more time here will help me get used to seeing everyone naked.” </p><p>Granny Smith cackled. “No harm in joinin’ us either, child.”</p><p>Scootaloo blushed and rubbed her thighs together. “We’ll see.” </p><p>Applejack belched and leaned back in her chair. “Hoo Wee! Is mah belly full! Some good grub tonight, Granny. On that note, Ah have a little announcement ta make. Seems the art club wants me ta do some more nude modelin’ for ‘em. By that, Ah mean a more involved project. Turns out, they wanted ta do some kind o’ fantasy exposé with body paintin’. Thought it might be fun.” </p><p>Apple Bloom got up and carried her dishes to the sink. “Like cosplay?” </p><p>“Ah dunno. Reckon it might be somethin’ akin ta that. All Ah know is that they offered me a significant reduction ta my semesterly tuition if Ah said yes. How could Ah possibly refuse?” </p><p>Apple Bloom shrugged. “If ya don’t mind sittin’ around fer hours on end while they paint every nook n’ cranny o’ yer body, I guess that sounds kind o’ interestin’. Ya should probably ask if yer pubes will need ta be waxed. Ain’t easy paintin’ over hair that thick, and it’ll look weird too.” </p><p>Applejack’s face paled. “Ah didn’t think ‘bout that…” </p><p>Scootaloo offered the blonde farmer a sympathetic smile. “Don’t sweat it, AJ. Waxing isn’t as bad as it sounds. In fact, there’s a special cream you can use down there instead. All you have to do is wash your pubes with warm water beforehand, then wipe it away with a damp cloth. Easy!” </p><p>“I’ll have ta ask Rarity ‘bout the process. Goin’ full smoothie doesn’t sit well with me at all.” </p><p>Mac began washing the dishes and looked back at his sister. “Sounds like a fair trade ta me.” </p><p>Applejack narrowed her eyes at Mac. “Hush, ya big galoot. Ya ain’t part o’ this deal.” </p><p>“Settle down, young-ins. There ain’t no reason ta git all bent outta shape over hair removal.” </p><p>Both siblings apologized to their grandmother simultaneously. </p><p>A half hour passed before dessert and coffee were served. Caramel Apple Cobbler topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Warmed in the oven, of course. Scootaloo only had a small helping on account of how much food she’d eaten for supper. If she had food at home like that for every meal, she’d wind up looking like a walrus before the end of the school year. Not that her aunts were bad cooks per say, but they tended to serve lighter, more nutritious dishes most evenings. They wanted to ensure that their beloved niece would grow up to be happy, healthy, and strong.  </p><p>Since the next day was the beginning of the weekend, Scootaloo didn’t go home until well after seven o’clock in the evening. Before she left Sweet Apple Acres (<i>courtesy of Applejack driving the truck</i>), Scootaloo shared a pleasantly warm embrace with Babs, this time less awkward than before. While she was still uncomfortable with Babs being nude around her, the very idea that they might share a romantic relationship together someday made her heart feel lighter. It was a significant step towards embracing her sexuality and accepting who she was, inside and out.</p>
