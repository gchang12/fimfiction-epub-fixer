		<h1>White Mist Resort (I)</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 9</b></p><p>Sweet Apple Acres, Ponyville </p><p>Applejack shuffled into the barn and placed the tree-pruning axe in its proper spot on the tool rack along the wall. Not only did this prevent the axe from getting lost, but it was much safer than letting it sit in the grass haphazardly. After all, getting your foot cut on an axe head was no laughing matter. For humans and dogs alike. Speaking of safety, Applejack removed her work gloves (<i>a necessity for preventing painful skin blisters</i>), placed them in the drawer below the tool rack, and used a washcloth to wipe her face. While she made her way back out to the truck, Winona took the liberty of licking Applejack’s leg. It was a lifelong habit of the border collie; she’d done so ever since she was but a tiny pup. The general consensus among the Apple Family was that Winona simply enjoyed the taste of anything that happened to be salty. </p><p>The blonde farmer ruffled her canine companion’s fur upon taking a big swig of water from a thermos. Yet another important safety rule while working on the farm was staying hydrated. Being nude all the time had the advantage of cooling down the body more efficiently while out in the heat, but that didn’t stop anyone from perspiring. One time, Granny caught Big Mac heading out to the fields without a thermos and smacked him upside the head for it, calling him a pig-headed fool. Suffice to say, the Apple Family took their wellbeing and safety quite seriously. </p><p>Apple Bloom joined her older sibling after she finished depositing scrap wood into the still furnaces. The two sisters sat next to one another on the grassy hill next to the barn, hardly uttering a word for quite some time. Sensing that something must have been wrong, Applejack reached over, wrapped her arm around Apple Bloom’s shoulder, and pulled her into a half-hug. </p><p>“What’s wrong, Sugarcube? You’ve been awfully quiet since yesterday.” </p><p>Apple Bloom sighed while she wiggled her toes in the grass. “Nothin’ that you’d be interested in hearin’ ‘bout. If Ah told ya what’s goin’ on, you’d just call me silly fer worryin’.” </p><p>“Can’t be silly if it’s got ya this worked up. Go on and tell me. Promise Ah won’t judge.” </p><p>Apple Bloom took a swig of water and cleared her throat. “There’s this group project the girls and Ah have been workin’ on at school. Ya know, the kind o’ project that everybody’s gotta do their part. Except, Scoots blew us off yesterday ta go play soccer with Rainbow Dash instead. Sweetie got real upset with her and they ended up havin’ a fight. I’ve been tryin’ ta figure out how ta git ‘em back together again and bury the hatchet, so ta speak.”</p><p>“Boy, howdy. Sounds like teenage drama ta me. Erm—no offence.” Applejack remarked. </p><p>“Everybody keeps sayin’ that! Ah suppose we’re all at the age where hormones are runnin’ amok and whatnot. In any case, Ah went ahead and asked Miss Cheerilee what Ah should do. She suggested that Ah level the playin’ field. Take ‘em both ta a place where it sets ‘em off balance. Ah figured Ah could invite ‘em over here, so they could hash things out. Sound good?”</p><p>Applejack rubbed her chin in thought. “Yer plan might work. But Ah feel like it needs somethin’ a little extra. How ‘bout ya git ‘em ta take their clothes off when they arrive? Ain’t nothin’ more honest and straightforward than skinship amongst friends. That’ll distract ‘em enough from their little hormone-fueled spat ta start thinkin’ ‘bout more important things, Ah reckon.”</p><p>Apple Bloom frowned. “Ah dunno, AJ. What yer suggestin’ sounds an awful lot like forced coercion. Believe me, I’ve tried mah best not ta be too preachy ‘bout our lifestyle with Sweetie and Scoots, no matter the circumstances. Just doesn’t sit right with me.” </p><p>“Look, Ah ain’t suggestin’ that yer friends need ta be forced into anythin’. If they don’t wanna strip, they don’t have ta. Just ask ‘em politely if they’d oblige yer request. Given the fact that Sweet Apple Acres is private property and they’re accustomed ta seein’ us walkin’ ‘roud nekkid, it might tip the scales in yer favor. Ya won’t know fer sure until ya ask.” </p><p>Apple Bloom scratched behind Winona’s ears before getting up to stretch her legs. “Fair enough. Say, Applejack. How’s yer college classes been goin’ lately? Any problems?”</p><p>“Can’t say there’s been any. Although, Ah really ought ta call Haki at some point…” </p><p>Apple Bloom cocked her head. “Y’all don’t text each other?”</p><p>Applejack blushed and rubbed the back of her neck. “Ah ain’t real big on textin’. Call me old-fashioned, but it feels kinda impersonal. Ah mean, sure we hang out at school sometimes but… we haven’t gone out on an official date yet, ta speak of. Does that make me a bad girlfriend?” </p><p>Apple Bloom ignored the question and offered a suggestion of her own instead. “The Harvest Festival break is comin’ up soon, so why don’t y’all do somethin’ special then? We’ve already got most o’ the hard work done ‘round the farm as is. Mac and Ah can take care o’ yer chores if ya decide ta go anywhere. C’mon, AJ! Say yes. Ya deserve some time off.”</p><p>“Fine. I’ll think about it. But mah decision hasn’t been set in stone yet, ya hear!” </p><p>Apple Bloom grinned from ear to ear and whistled for Winona to follow her. “I’ll give ya some time alone ta mull it over. As fer me, I’m gonna head back ta the house and take a nice, hot bubble bath. Maybe send Scoots n’ Sweetie a text. We’ll see. Later, AJ!” </p><p>While Applejack began to consider her options, unsure of what to do or where to go, her phone started ringing. She sprang to her feet, walked over to the truck, and retrieved her phone from where it sat on the passenger seat. A quick glance at the caller ID screen told Applejack that it was Roz. Knowing full-well that her friend could be a chatterbox if given the opportunity, Applejack hesitated to swipe her finger across the accept call button. In the end, Applejack realized that Roz might just be the best person to talk to regarding her date with Haki. </p><p>“Mornin’, Roz. How’re ya doin’ this fine Saturday?” </p><p>“Quite well, thank you!” The bubbly nudist responded. </p><p>Applejack shuffled her feet in the grass. “That’s good. Any particular reason ya called?” </p><p>“Do I need one to have a casual conversation with my friend?” </p><p>Applejack scratched the back of her ear. “Ah suppose not. We just finished up our chores fer the day here at the farm. So—um—Ah got some free time on mah hands now. Ya got any plans fer the remainder o’ the day or…”</p><p>“That is part of the reason why I called you today! I was wondering, if perhaps, you would like to do something fun with me during the Harvest Festival. You see, my Uncle Alyosha &amp; Aunt Himiko have extended an invitation to stay at their <i>onsen</i> resort in the mountains. They told me that I could bring along a few friends if I so desired. Please, Applejack! It would make me very happy if you would come along. I get bored just hanging around my family all day…” </p><p>Sensing an opportunity, Applejack perked up. “What the heck is an <i>onsen</i>?”</p><p>“Oh, well it is simply the Japanese term for a hot spring. Trust me, Applejack. The resort is picturesque and there are plenty of other things to do there other than bathing. Like table tennis, hot rock massages, and hiking if that suits your tastes. The entire resort is clothing optional, as per my uncle’s specifications. You wouldn’t have to worry about packing much.”</p><p>Applejack hummed. “Ya don’t say. If Ah were so inclined, could Ah invite Haki along?” </p><p>“The more the merrier, I say! He is most welcome to come along with us.” </p><p>Applejack cleared her throat. “Welp, Ah reckon I’ll take ya up on yer offer. When should Ah tell Haki ta git ready?”</p><p>“We could leave as early as tomorrow morning, if you wish. No need to worry about transportation. My uncle will send one of his drivers to pick us up. And do not worry about expenses either! Everything is covered under my special family discount.”</p><p>“That all sounds like it’d cost a pretty penny. Are ya sure Ah can’t contribute—”</p><p>“<b>NYET</b>,” Roz affirmed, “I want to treat you this time around!” </p><p>“Alrighty then. If ya insist, Ah won’t look a gift horse in the mouth.” </p><p>Applejack could hear Roz clapping her hands in the background. “<i>Prevoskhodno</i>! You will not regret it, Applejack. Ooohhhhhh~ We’re going to have so much fun! <b>I’M EXCITED</b>!!!!” </p><p>“Yeah, Ah can tell. Well—umm—see ya later, Roz.” </p><p>“Don’t you mean early, Applejack? Remember: we will be leaving at six o’clock in the morning. It is a long drive to the resort, so we need to hit the road as soon as possible in order to arrive in time for lunch. I’m certain that my Aunt and Uncle have something marvelous planned.”</p><p>“Not a problem. I’m an early-riser.” Applejack affirmed. </p><p>“As expected of a farmer! I bid you farewell and a pleasant day.” </p><p>Applejack turned off her phone with a quick tap and started walking back towards the family abode. Upon entering the kitchen, the blonde nudist cracked open the fridge and grabbed a bottle of beer, causally swigging the golden <i>weißbräu</i> while she made her way into the living room. Applejack believed that it was still a bit too early in the day to be consuming alcohol but beer did not pack the same punch as hard liquor. Not even close. Given how Granny guzzled down shots of whiskey on the slightest whim, whenever and wherever she pleased, it was a genuine medical miracle that her liver hadn’t been turned into a giant pickle decades ago.</p><p>The three siblings had made an earnest attempt to get their grandmother to curb her nasty drinking habit, but she stubbornly refused to stop stating: “It’s mah body; I’ll embalm it however Ah damn-well please. Less effort fer the undertaker”. Her cantankerousness notwithstanding, the doctor always gave her a clean bill of health after every annual checkup. It served, at least in her mind, as irrefutable proof of her longevity. Of course, this was the same woman who worked harder than most people half her age, and was twice as strong as them too.</p><p>Dismissing the pang of guilt that remained in her conscience, Applejack plopped onto the couch and turned on the TV. An annoyed grunt and fifty channels later signaled that there simply weren't any programs worth watching at the moment. Once her beer was finished, Applejack belched loudly and laid back on the couch, crossing one leg over the other. As if summoned by magic, Winona scampered into the living room and joined her mistress for an impromptu snuggle session. The border collie smelled slightly of soap and shampoo. </p><p>“Ah reckon Apple Bloom’s takin’ her bath now.” </p><p>Winona let out a soft whuff and licked Applejack’s face. </p><p>“Ah know ya like takin’ baths but it ain’t proper fer a pooch ta git in the tub with people.” </p><p>Wagging her tail expectantly, Winona pointed her snout towards the kitchen. </p><p>“You’ll git some victuals soon enough. I’m sure Ganny’s got somethin’ nice planned fer lunch.” </p><p>With nothing better to do, Applejack’s mind drifted while she ran her fingers through Winona’s fur. She began to think of Haki and the upcoming trip to the <i>onsen</i> resort. A simple text would not do. She would need to call him, at the very least, perhaps even live video chat was an option. Applejack leaned over and picked up her phone, turning it on once more. Her stomach churned with a swarm of butterflies, her mouth became dry, as if stuffed full of cotton balls. She let out a sharp sigh as she enabled the video option in the call settings. </p><p>“Why am Ah actin’ like such a nervous nelly? It’s just a phone call. It ain’t like Haki hasn’t seen me nekkid before. What do ya think, gal? Should Ah go fer it or… wait until later?”</p><p>Winona barked once and nudged Applejack’s armpit in response. </p><p>“Ok, fine! I’ll git the blasted call over with.”</p><p>For what seemed like an eternity, Applejack waited for Haki to respond, unsure if she was calling him at an appropriate time of the day. She was just about to resign herself to sending a text instead, when Haki appeared on screen shirtless and soaking wet. Unused to seeing him in such a state, Applejack coughed loudly and tried her best to act casual. As was apparent by his befuddled expression, the young swimmer wasn’t expecting to see his beau naked either. A painful moment of awkward silence stretched between them, only broken by Winona’s whuff. </p><p>“Uh… howdy, Haki. Did Ah catch ya at a bad time?” </p><p>“I was just finishing up my practice routine in the pool. Need stay fit and conditioned for the team! But I’m sure you take that mantra to heart, considering that you work on a farm. It really shows! You look amazing today. Not that you don’t look amazing any other day of the week but—UGH—just forget I said anything. What’s up?” Haki asked hesitantly, wincing slightly. </p><p>“Ah was wonderin’ if we might discuss the up comin’ Harvest Festival break. Got any plans?” </p><p>Haki rubbed the back of his neck. “Not really. Do you have something in mind?” </p><p>Applejack blushed slightly and began playing with a strand of her hair. “Roz extended me an invitation this mornin’ ta visit her uncle’s hot spring resort over the break. She said Ah could bring along a plus one. All expenses paid too. So—um—would that pique yer interest, Haki?” </p><p>“Yeah. I think I’d like that. Look, Applejack I’m… sorry if it seems like I’ve been ignoring you. With everything going on at school, homework, and the swim team, I haven’t gotten the chance to spend much time with you. I promise that I’ll make it up to you during the break.” </p><p>Applejack offered him a warm smile. “Haki, ya don’t have ta apologize fer that. In fact, I’m just as guilty fer bein’ too busy ta spend time with ya as o’ late. What’s important is that we’ve got ourselves an opportunity ta do somethin’ special and we might as well take advantage of it.” </p><p>“Agreed. Is there anything in particular that I should pack?” </p><p>Applejack chuckled. “Ya shouldn’t need much. It’s a clothin’ optional resort.” </p><p>“Oh, I… see.” </p><p>Applejack frowned, hoping that she hadn’t made Haki reconsider his answer. “Goes without sayin’ that Roz &amp; Ah won’t be wearnin’ anythin’ other than our birthday suits if we can help it. Ya don’t have ta join in but… I’d consider it a personal favor if ya gave naturism a try. After a while, ya might come ta enjoy it like Ah do. Who knows?”</p><p>Haki took in a deep breath and sighed. “I suppose it’s only fair. You’ve been honest with me about your lifestyle, so it’s high time that I put my money where my mouth is. Besides, I talked to my aunt about naturism and did a bit of experimentation of my own. Just to see what it’s like.” </p><p>Applejack cocked her brow. “Do anythin’ interestin’?” </p><p>“Just normal stuff. Like sleeping in the nude, the occasional skinny dip. Nothing too dramatic.” </p><p>Excitement bubbled up in Applejack’s chest. “How’d ya like it so far?” </p><p>“Well—erm—I suppose it’s not too bad. Not having to worry about a speedo is nice.” </p><p>Applejack nodded in agreement. “Ah reckon ya might have the same problem as mah brother. Too much banana and not enough hammock ta hold it in. Heh. Ah figure that bathin’ suits have gotta be one o’ the most pointless inventions ever. All they’re good fer is givin’ ya wedgies or weighin’ ya down in the water. Rarity seems ta fancy ‘em though. Same with sexy lingerie.” </p><p>Haki laughed nervously at the unspoken implication of Applejack’s joke, despite there being some truth behind it. “Everyone’s entitled to their own tastes and opinions.”</p><p>“It’s settled then. Ya best pack what ya need quick, considerin’ that we’re leavin’ bright and early tomorrow mornin’. Roz said her driver would pick us at the front gate of Sweet Apple Acres. If ya want, I can swing by yer aunt’s place tomorrow beforehand.”</p><p>“Sounds good. What time should I be ready by?” </p><p>Applejack tapped her chin. “Five o’clock just ta be safe. Doesn’t take long fer me ta git there but I’d rather not miss our ride ta the resort. See ya then, Haki.” </p><hr/><p>Both Haki and Applejack decided to keep it simple as far as their attire was concerned. Canterlot Valley was pleasantly warm all year around, so the young couple stuck to jeans and t-shirts. They packed lightly too, considering that the entire property was supposedly clothing optional. At the very least, Applejack reasoned, she would remain nude for the duration of the Harvest Festival once they arrived at the <i>onsen</i> resort. The blonde farmer looked over at her boyfriend and frowned. It was apparent that Haki didn’t seem keen on the idea of spending his entire break wearing nothing but a smile. Applejack reached over and held his hand, giving it a firm squeeze to show her support. He returned the gesture and let out a heavy sigh. </p><p>“Ah can tell yer nervous, Haki. Wanna talk ‘bout it while we wait?” </p><p>The collegiate swimmer shrugged. “Now’s as good a time as any, I guess. Like I mentioned before, I’ve been experimenting with naturism for a little while. Only at my aunt’s house, of course. She’s been very supportive of my decision and has offered me tons of advice. It’s not quite as weird to me as before but… being naked with you at the <i>onsen</i> is a different matter entirely.”</p><p>Applejack leaned in closer and wrapped Haki in a half-hug. “I’m a tad nervous too, ta be honest. This is the first time I’ve ever gone out on a trip with a fella Ah fancy. Doubly so since yer the first boyfriend I’ve ever had period. Look on the bright side, Haki. You’ve already seen me in mah birthday suit plenty o’ times. That there’s half the battle!” </p><p>“You’ve never seen me naked before. Well, completely at any rate…” </p><p>Applejack rubbed Haki’s back encouragingly. “Why’s that a problem? Ah don’t think you’ve got anythin’ ta be ashamed of. Ah mean, sure, we tease Mac fer havin’ a big ole mole on his family jewels but it’s all in the name o’ good-natured fun. Ah don’t want ya ta feel like ya have ta take yer clothes off fer mah sake. That ain’t what relationships are all ‘bout.”</p><p>“Aunt Z said something similar. It’s just that I haven’t had much experience with relationships either up to this point. I tended to focus most of my attention on schoolwork and swimming. The last girlfriend I dated, things—umm—didn’t work out so well between us. We didn’t separate on good terms. I don’t want what we have to end up that way if I can help it.”</p><p>Applejack kissed Haki’s cheek and smiled. “Ah don’t think that’ll happen.”</p><p>“Perhaps not. <b>UGH</b>! Am I just overthinking again?”</p><p>Applejack rested her head against Haki’s shoulder. “Nah. Ah reckon it’s normal fer folks ta ponder such scenarios. I’ve been known ta do it too on occasion. More importantly, Ah want ya ta understand that I’ll be as supportive as Ah can no matter what ya choose ta do, Haki.” </p><p>“I know you will. And I appreciate it, Applejack. Really, I do. But what kind of boyfriend would I be if I didn’t show the same level of commitment to understanding your lifestyle? That’s why I feel like I need to give going <i>au naturale</i> a try while we’re at the resort. I owe you that much.”</p><p>Before Applejack could respond, a black <i>Aurus Senat</i> pulled up to the entrance of Sweet Apple Acres. Even with the windows closed, the young couple could hear Russian pop music blasting at full volume within. A moment later, the rear passenger door opened, revealing a familiar face and a whole lot more. Roz waved to them both enthusiastically in all her pale-skinned glory, unconcerned that they were shooting her strange looks. In particular, Haki had a difficult time keeping his eyes above Roz’s neckline. She padded over to Applejack and gave her friend a bone-crushing hug. An embrace that Applejack hesitantly returned while Haki busied himself by loading their luggage into the luxury car’s trunk.  </p><p>“Good morning, Applejack! Are you as excited as I am to visit the onsen?” </p><p>Applejack wasn’t sure if Roz was just particularly perky this morning or had decided to wear her nipple studs again. She supposed it was a combination of both. “Reckon Ah am. So—umm—any reason why yer nekkid? Ah was under the impression we’d take our clothes off once we got there, not beforehand.”</p><p>Roz jumped in place and giggled. “The funny thing is, in my excitement, I forgot to put anything on when I woke up this morning. By the time I realized that I was bereft of clothing, Boris had driven half the distance to Sweet Apple Acres already. My Aunt &amp; Uncle will not mind, I assure you! They are used to seeing me this way. Does my nudity upset you somehow?”</p><p>Applejack rubbed the back of her neck. “It doesn’t bother me none. I’m more concerned ‘bout Haki. He’s never… seen ya nekkid before. Ah imagine it’ll be a might distractin’ for him durin’ our trip ta the resort, if ya catch mah meanin’.”</p><p>Roz looked down at her breasts, adjusted a stud, and cocked her head. “He is the handsome <i>negry</i> loading the luggage into the trunk, yes? I can see why you like him so much. Such strong, robust legs! I wonder if his third leg is equally so. Have you gotten the chance to test it out yet?” </p><p>Applejack’s cheeks flushed a deep shade of crimson. “<b>ROZ</b>!! First o’ all, ya can’t call Zebricans that word. It ain’t proper. Second, we haven’t gotten that far yet. That’s part o’ the reason Ah invited him along. We’ve both been too busy with school n’ such ta devote much time towards developin’ our relationship. A little rest n’ relaxation will do us wonders.” </p><p>Roz blushed in turn, shuffling her feet in the grass. “My apologies. <i>Negry</i> is what we call all dark-skinned people in my homeland. I did not mean any offence by using the term.”</p><p>“Well, alright. Just make sure ya don’t ever call him that.” </p><p>Roz clapped her hands together. “I have an idea! Why don’t you take off your clothes too! That way, Haki will be distracted by the both of us equally. We can sit together on one side, and he can sit opposite of us. What is the phrase—hmm—two for the price of one!”</p><p>“Ah think I’ll pass on that, sugarcube. We need ta git movin’ along anyway.” </p><p>Roz scampered back to the car and entered on the left-hand side, while Haki and Applejack entered on the right. Their driver, a suit-wearing, black-haired man with a bushy moustache turned down the music and acknowledged their presence with a simple grunt. Roz said something to him in her native tongue and he proceeded to drive towards their destination. A few minutes passed and no one said anything. Roz appeared to be her cheerful self with a friendly smile spread across her lips. Poor Haki, on the other hand, was tense and clearly uncomfortable at the prospect of sitting directly across from a nude Russian girl. It should also be noted that Roz was unconcerned with being modest and sat whichever way she felt was most comfortable. </p><p>“It is nice to finally meet you, Mr. Haki. My name is Roz! How are you doing?” </p><p>Haki chuckled nervously. “Just Haki is fine. I—uh—I’m ok. And you?” </p><p>“Very well, thank you. Ooooh! I’m sure that you two will love the hot springs~ They are said to have special properties. Such as making the skin smoother and more radiant. I also heard there is something in the water that increases virility in men, but I am unsure how true the claim is.”</p><p>Haki bit his lip, trying to ignore just how much Roz jiggled while she conversed. Like many of her countrymen, she loved to talk with her hands. “Sounds like an interesting theory. So… where are you from originally?” </p><p>“My family hails from Stalliongrad. That is where I was born too! I came here to study and earn my degree as a foreign exchange student. But unfortunately, I found that it is quite difficult making friends. That is why I am so happy to have met Applejack.”</p><p>Haki frowned. “Oh. Well, then I’d be remiss if I didn’t try to be your friend too.”</p><p>“Da! A most agreeable arrangement. Would you like some refreshments while we wait?” </p><p>Haki shrugged. “Sure. I could eat. What do you have?” </p><p>Roz opened the mini fridge underneath her seat and pulled out a thermos of tea, crackers, and a gold tin. “Only the finest caviar for my friends! Please, eat as much as you’d like.” </p><p>“<b>HOLY SHIT</b>! Is that Beluga caviar?” </p><p>Roz blinked owlishly. “Is there something wrong with your serving? Uncle Alyosha tells me that it is the very best caviar one can buy on the market.”</p><p>Upon pouring himself and Applejack a mug full of hot tea, Haki cleared his throat. “Roz, please don’t take this the wrong way but… how are you able to afford that kind of stuff? The car seems pretty swanky too. Is your family rich or something?” </p><p>Roz tapped her chin in thought. “My papa says that we make our money through a diverse distribution network. I tried asking him one time what exactly it was that we shipped around the world, but he told me not to worry about it. All that matters to me is that I get to follow my dream of becoming a famous pastry chef. It is what I’ve wanted ever since I was a little girl.”</p><p>Haki felt his butthole pucker while he nibbled on a caviar covered cracker. “Well—uh—your dad sounds like he’s a pretty busy guy. I assume your family still lives in Stalliongrad?” </p><p>“Correct. At some point, I would like to visit them. As I mentioned before, it can get very lonely living by yourself in a foreign country without any friends…” Roz answered in a soft voice. </p><p>“Do you have any idea how dangerous it is to befriend a Russian Mafia Princess?!” Haki whispered in Applejack’s ear. </p><p>Applejack jabbed her elbow into Haki’s ribs. “Ah had no idea that’s what her folks did fer a livin’. This is the first time I’ve ever heard ‘bout it! Listen, Haki. Roz ain’t a bad apple. She’s just a lonely gal whose family happens ta run a less than reputable business back home. Cut her some slack, will ya? Honest ta Pete! Ah thought ya were better than that.” </p><p>After taking a swig of tea, Haki sighed. “I’m sorry, AJ. I just don’t want us to get caught in the crossfire. Can we at least agree on that?”</p><p>“Judgin’ by her father’s attitude, seems ta me like he keeps Roz outta the family business.” </p><p>Haki rubbed his temples. “So, it would seem. Don’t make me regret trusting you on this.”</p><p>Roz gently placed her hand on Applejack’s thigh and frowned. “Have I offended you somehow? You two seem upset with me. If I have talked too much, I can be quiet for—”</p><p>“Mah apologies, Roz. Haki and Ah were just havin’ a little discussion amongst ourselves. Nothin’ ta be concerned ‘bout. Ya didn’t do anythin’ wrong, Ah promise.”</p><p>The dark-haired Russian fidgeted in her seat and wiggled her toes in the plush carpet. “Ok. But please be honest with me if I am causing any issues for either of you. People do not often say it directly to my face, but I know that I have a tendency to be a real <i>bolvan</i> sometimes.” </p><p>Roz looked so dejected that Haki immediately came to regret what he’d said earlier. He’d only just met the woman and was already jumping to conclusions that might not be true. With an encouraging nudge from Applejack, he placed his hand on Roz’s knee. “I think we might’ve gotten off on the wrong foot. This whole situation is just so alien to me that I’m a bit on edge.”</p><p>Roz blushed and played with one of her ear rings. “There can be no doubt that I contributed to the awkwardness of our first meeting. You’re not a… naturist like us, are you, Haki?” </p><p>“No, but my aunt is. I’ve been staying with her since she works at Canterlot University.”</p><p>Roz perked up and nibbled on a cracker. “She is the neg—plant professor, yes? I like her! Miss Zecora is a very good teacher. Kind, patient, and beautiful. I did not know she was a naturist!” </p><p>“Yeah. It ties in with our native Zebrican culture, apparently. My dad shied away from tradition and didn’t teach me much about our roots. I only recently started learning about how my ancestors lived from my aunt, including the whole ‘connecting with nature’ bit.”</p><p>“And how do you like it so far?” </p><p>Haki chuckled. “Takes a lot of getting used to, I’ll admit.”</p><p>Roz suddenly took hold of Haki’s hand. “Not to worry, my friend! You shall have ample opportunity to experience the joys of clothes-free living at my uncle’s resort. That is why he built it in the first place. Bearing that in mind, do not be surprised if he is nude when we arrive.” </p><p>“Does that mean your aunt will be too?” Haki asked hesitantly. </p><p>Roz nodded. “I believe so. My aunt and uncle have lived as naturists for nearly as long as they have been married. Aunt Himiko was initially hesitant to embrace the lifestyle because she was raised in a very strict, conservative household. But she came to appreciate it over time.” </p><p>“Like I told AJ, I’m willing to give it a try. Erm—even though I’ll be a nervous wreck at first.” </p><p>Applejack rolled her eyes. “Ah still think yer makin’ a mountain outta a molehill.” </p><p>Boris finally tapped on the window to indicate that they had arrived at the resort. Roz rubbed her hands together excitedly and squealed. “<b>WE HAVE ARRIVED AT LAST</b>!!!” </p><hr/><p>Everyone exited the car in an orderly fashion while Boris took care of putting away the luggage. Applejack took one look at the resort and let out an impressed whistle. It was like traveling back in time and visiting the estate of a wealthy Daimyo during the shogunate era. Sprawling Japanese Zen gardens set around the main complex gave the resort a near mystical quality, and served to enhance the natural beauty of the mountainous terrain beyond. The trio made their way over to a koi pond, observing the beautiful fish while they glided through the water with graceful ease. </p><p>Roz squatted by the edge of the pond and frowned. “I’m so sorry, Mr. Koi. We don’t have any food for you. But! I promise that I shall come back later and give you a treat!” </p><p>Applejack shook her head. “Roz, they ain’t goldfish. Ya can’t just give ‘em flakes. I’m sure yer aunt and uncle pay a pretty penny ta keep ‘em healthy n’ fed proper. Ask before ya do anythin’.” </p><p>Roz crossed her arms underneath her breasts and pouted. “I wasn’t going to throw random food in there! Uncle Alyosha let me feed them before when I was a little girl. I know what to do!” </p><p>“Alright. Ah believe ya. Just was makin’ sure ya didn’t cause any trouble.” </p><p>Haki looked around and noticed a distinct lack of guests. “This place is amazing but where is everyone? I was under the impression that there’d be more people staying here.” </p><p>Roz chuckled and offered her companions a sheepish smile. “About that. I—um—must have forgotten to mention that the entire resort has been reserved just for us during the break. Don’t worry! My uncle does so whenever there is a visitor from the family. I assure you that the resort is very popular all year round and attracts many guests.” </p><p>With a shrug, Haki took Applejack’s hand and they walked beside Roz toward the entrance. Atop the doors was a large, decorative plaque with the kana: ホワイトミスト written on it. Before Applejack could ask what the phrase meant, a bald-headed man dressed in a navy-blue kimono walked through the entrance and waved at the trio. He was exceptionally tall, built like a mountain and had a thick, bushy black beard. His stormy eyes were friendly, despite his intimidating appearance. The sound of Roz’s bare feet pattering against the wooden floor while she ran towards the man left Applejack and Haki dumbfounded. The man simply chuckled as she leapt into his arms and gave him a patented Roz-style bear hug. Setting her down he beckoned for the young couple to follow him towards the lobby. </p><p>“Uncle Alyosha! It is so nice to see you again. I have missed you!” </p><p>The big man patted his niece’s head. “As have I, <i>zefir</i>. These are the friends you mentioned?” </p><p>“Yes, Uncle. Their names are Applejack and Haki, respectively. They both attend the same university as I do. That is how I met Applejack. Well, sort of. It was actually during a sketching session. She volunteered to be one of the nude models. Isn’t that wonderful?!” </p><p>Alyosha stroked his beard. “Da. She has a good build for it from what I can tell. Welcome to <i>Howaitomisuto Onsen</i>! I am Alyosha Rozmanov, host, and co-owner of the resort. But you may call me Al, if you wish. All my friends do. Please allow me to show you to your accommodations. Roz told me that you two are a couple, is that correct?”</p><p>Applejack and Haki both blushed and nodded in agreement. “That’s right, sir. We haven’t gotten the chance ta spend any quality time with each other as o’ late. Thought this might be a good opportunity ta rest, relax, n’ soak up the scenery.”</p><p>Al laughed. “There is plenty of soaking to be had, I assure you! In case you were curious, the sign outside means ‘White Mist Hot Springs’. A very literal interpretation of what goes on around here, but it sounds much more romantic in Japanese. My wife insisted on it.”</p><p>“Reckon it’s a right proper name fer the place. So—uh—Ah was wonderin’ if we might have a room ta ourselves. If it ain’t too much trouble. Ya know, since we’ll be wantin’ some privacy.” </p><p>Al thumped Applejack’s back in a friendly manner. It caused her a noticeable amount of pain, even though she pretended that it didn’t. “Roz mentioned as much. I took the liberty of preparing the deluxe couple’s suite for you two. You can even watch the sunrise over the mountains.”</p><p>“We certainly appreciate it, Mr. Rozmanov. Thank ya, kindly.” </p><p>Al clicked his tongue. “I must insist that you call me Al. There is no need for such formality here. In fact, why are you two still dressed? Take off your clothes. Get comfortable. Relax.” </p><p>An icy knot formed in Haki’s stomach. “You mean… like right here, right now?” </p><p>As if to answer his question, Alyosha slipped out of his kimono and instructed Boris to put it away somewhere. Haki’s pupils shrank to pin pricks when he saw just how big and hairy the Russian man was. A massive tattoo depicting the dark god, <i>Chernabog</i>, stretched across his back and upper arms like the canvas of a medieval painting. Unsure how to approach the situation, Haki looked to his girlfriend for support. With a shred of hesitation, Applejack began taking off her clothes and stood naked as the day she was born. Roz took it upon herself to initiate yet another embrace, relishing the tactile sensation of flesh meeting bare flesh. Applejack rolled her eyes at the bubbly girl’s antics, but had to admit that Roz was a good hugger. </p><p>Alyosha placed his hand on Haki’s shoulder. “What is wrong, Mr. Haki? Are you self-conscious about showing off your body? There is no reason to be. We are all naturists. Go on. Strip.” </p><p>“I’m not—sorry, guys. This is <b>REALLY</b> awkward for me. Just… give me a moment.” </p><p>Like a gangly teenager in the school locker room, Haki took off his clothes slowly and hesitantly. When he finally kicked off his cotton briefs, it marked the first occasion he’d ever been naked in front of Applejack and so many other strangers, beyond swim practice. A little voice in the back of his mind assured him that there was nothing to worry about and he was, as Applejack had so eloquently put it, making a mountain out of a molehill. Haki had to resist the urge to cover up his privates, grateful at the very least that the weather was warm and hadn’t caused any shrinkage. </p><p>While Haki shuffled around awkwardly, Applejack appraised his body with keen interest. She’d been taught from an early age not to judge anyone by the color of their skin, shape of their body, or physical imperfections they might have possessed. By all accounts, Applejack should have been used to seeing the human form in all its natural splendor at this point. Yet, just because she was a naturist, did not mean she was immune to appreciating the appeal of a person’s physique. </p><p>Applejack bit her lip as she took in every contour of Haki’s body. Smooth, chocolatey skin taught with muscle lurking just beneath the surface. If it hadn’t been obvious before, Applejack could definitely tell that Haki was a professional athlete. In particular, she focused on his butt cheeks and stomach, noting how delectably firm they were. Warm, tingly butterflies fluttered around in her stomach, slowly spreading their heat towards her unmentionables. Applejack had to close her eyes for a moment, take a deep breath, and remind herself that it was just the hormones talking. A perfectly natural reaction to an attractive male specimen. Eeyup. </p><p>The blonde naturist allowed herself a quick peek at the goods, so to speak. Haki wasn’t even close to her brother’s length. A little bigger than average, Applejack mused, but that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. No, what really caught her attention was the sheer girth of Haki’s member. It was thick, veiny, and the bulbous head flared out to the sides ever so slightly. He was circumcised and waxed off all of his pubic hair, unlike Alyosha. Overall, Applejack could unequivocally say that she very much liked what she saw and preferred Haki <i>au naturale</i>.  </p><p>Applejack flashed her boyfriend a supportive smile and blushed. “See? It ain’t so bad.”</p><p>Before Haki could respond, Roz squatted onto her haunches and stared below his waist intently. She giggled after Haki took a few steps back. “I have never seen such a thing before. Your manhood is like a thick-cut <i>Krovyanka</i>! Are all Zebricans similarly endowed or are you—”</p><p>Knowing how air-headed his niece could be, Alyosha gently grabbed her by the arm. “Let’s not make our guest feel uncomfortable by asking too many questions, <i>zefir</i>. Why don’t you run along to the café and grab a snack? I’m sure you’re hungry after being on the road for so many hours. I believe Boris was making some sweetmeat <i>pirozhki</i>. Those are your favorite, no?” </p><p>While Roz scampered off towards the café, Alyosha bowed to Haki. “My apologies, sir. Natalia is a sweet girl but sometimes she has trouble picking up on the—what’s the word—mood of the room, I believe the phrase goes. I hope she didn’t make you feel too uncomfortable.”</p><p>Haki rubbed the back of his neck with one hand and subconsciously used the other to cover up his manhood. “I’m not going to lie, that was pretty damn awkward. But… I need to get used to this whole walking around in the buff thing sooner or later. It might as well be now.” </p><p>“I’ll just let you two get settled in then. If you need anything, don’t hesitate to ring the front desk. We have a gourmet-rated café and room service is available twenty-four seven. Hah. So long as you don’t mind an eclectic blend of Japanese and Russian food, that is. You haven’t lived until you’ve eaten a bowl of my wife’s smoked eel borscht!”</p><p>Applejack returned the bow and smiled. “We’ll keep that in mind whenever we start feelin’ a might peckish. Thanks, fer yer hospitality, Al.”  </p><p>With everyone else in the room gone except for his girlfriend, Haki let out an irritated huff. “I swear that woman doesn’t understand the concept of personal space. Honestly, how much of her behavior can truly be blamed on being air headed? She practically was poking her nose around my junk! You don’t think mine looks strange compared to other guy’s dicks, do you?”</p><p>Caught off guard by the question, Applejack became flustered. “How the heck should Ah know?!” </p><p>“Well, you’re the naturist. I figure you’ve seen plenty of cocks flopping around.”</p><p>Applejack blushed and narrowed her eyes. “Is that what ya think Ah do all day? Stare at everyone’s unmentionables? Land’s sakes, Haki! That ain’t nowhere near proper etiquette.” </p><p>“I don’t know! I’ve never dated a naturist before. It’s not as though my aunt ever took me to any clubs or introduced me to her naked friends. This is uncharted territory for me, Applejack!” </p><p>Applejack sighed. “Ah didn’t mean ta snap at ya, Haki. If ya want the honest truth, Ah don’t think there’s anythin’ wrong with yer twig n’ berries or any other part o’ ya fer that matter. One o’ the core values o’ naturism is that ya don’t judge folks based on their appearance. This ain’t some high school locker room size measurin’ contest. All ya gotta do here is be yerself.”</p><p>“Just to be clear: when you say twig and berries, does that mean—”</p><p>Applejack put her hands on her hips and gave Haki the stink eye. “Ah don’t mean a literal twig, ya doofus! Quit worryin’ ‘bout yer size n’ shape. Yer family jewels are perfectly fine the way they were made. Don’t let what Roz said rattle yer chains too much.”</p><p>Feeling somewhat mollified, Haki carefully wrapped his arms around Applejack’s waist and pulled her in closer for an affectionate kiss on the lips. Afterwards, she leaned into his embrace and rested her head against Haki’s chest. He ran his fingers through her silky blonde hair, took in a deep breath, and savored Applejack’s natural scent mixed with the floral skin cream she’d used after her morning shower. Earthy, feminine, and uniquely her own. The young couple stood together for a time, content to enjoy the warmth only their bare skin could provide. Applejack was the one who finally broke their embrace when she heard her stomach gurgle. One sheepish chuckle later, she suggested that they head over to the café as well to rustle up some grub.</p>
