		<h1>The Brewer &amp; The Baker</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 15</b></p><p>Sweet Apple Acres, Ponyville</p><p>Johnathan Apple-Seed examined the glass mason jar carefully as he held it up to the light. The apple cider contained within had taken on a golden-brown hue. Within moments, the impurities began to settle at the bottom of the jar, forming a dark circle. Clicking his tongue, Johnny placed the jar back on top of an oak whiskey barrel that served as a temporary table. </p><p>“Ya reckon it’s ready?” Big Mac inquired as he walked over with a tray of pint glasses in hand. Mac’s nakedness no longer bothered the former Manehattanite but he wasn’t exactly eager to shed his own clothing anytime soon. Johnny’s typical work attire was a loose black t-shirt with a matching pair of track pants, and comfortable sneakers. Not exactly what one would call professional attire, but compared to the rest of his family, it was better than nothing at all. </p><p>“Only one way to find out,” Johnny replied with a shrug. “Taste test.” </p><p>Macintosh smirked as he set the tray down and grabbed the mason jar. With a twist of his burly hands, the airtight seal was broken. He gave it an experimental sniff and found that it smelled like tangy apples and a blend of assorted spices. “So far, so good.”</p><p>Outwardly, Johnny remained impassive but inwardly he felt a surge of pride in his chest. He’d leapt at the chance to join the family business a few weeks ago when Mac had suggested they focus their efforts on concocting a hard cider recipe. The young man had done plenty of research beforehand and poured his heart into the project. Now, was the moment of truth.  </p><p>Carefully, Mac poured a draft into two glasses. He grunted in approval as the amber liquid fizzed and formed a head on the top. Setting the jar down, he picked the glasses up and offered one to Johnny. After licking his lips, the young man accepted the glass and raised it in a silent toast. </p><p>The alcohol content was a tad strong. Sure, he could taste the apples, but it was just… underwhelming overall. Lowering his glass, Johnny swore. “Damn it!”</p><p>“What’s eating ya?” Mac asked, lowering his now half-full glass. “Tastes fine ta me.” </p><p>“Yeah, but it’s not… phenomenal.” Johnny put his glass down. “We need to make this the signature Apple Family Cider, not some copycat brew you can find anywhere.” </p><p>Mac hummed as he gulped down the rest of his draft, “It’s yer first attempt, Johnny. Can’t expect ta craft a masterpiece right off the bat. Takes time, patience, and refinement.” </p><p>“Easy for you to say…”</p><p>“On account of me bein’ an unsophisticated redneck?” Johnny’s brief feeling of panic was quelled by the wink Mac shot him. “Frankly, Ah don’t know much ‘bout these here fruity drinks. Prefer me a good finger o’ whiskey or beer. Luckily, Ah called in a second opinion.`` </p><p>“Who?” Johnny asked. Before Mac could answer the door to the cellar swung open and the patter of bare feet on wood echoed through the casks. </p><p>“Hello! I heard that a pair of big, strong men needed my help~”</p><p>“Over here Roz!” Mac called out before glancing at his cousin. “Brace yerself.” </p><p>Worries about his lackluster batch of cider fled from Johnny’s mind as Mac’s friend skipped into view. While he may have gotten used to the sight of his naked female relatives over the last few weeks, the sight of a curvaceous, pale-skinned young woman jiggling around everywhere sent the blood rushing from one head to another. The raven-haired woman’s face was split into a toothy grin as she practically leapt at Mac and gave him a hug. </p><p>“Found you!”</p><p>Mac returned the hug with a snort, “Ya hugged me five minutes ago, Roz” </p><p>“And I have done so again.” Johnny’s eyes were fixed on the woman’s generous bosom as she turned around. Her accent had a distinctively Russian tilt to it. “You must be Johnny Appleseed!”</p><p>Johnny shifted his attention to her baby blue eyes. “That’s me. I--<b>OOF</b>.” </p><p>In the back of his mind, Johnny supposed it wasn’t that unusual for the Apples to be friends with other naturists. Yet, the last thing he had expected today was to meet a gorgeous girl like Roz. Johnny returned the hug awkwardly as he marvelled at how sinfully soft Roz’s body was. He blushed when he felt her nipple studs rub up against his chest. Even through the fabric of his t-shirt, the sensation was quite obvious. He wondered if she was doing it on purpose.</p><p>“What a pleasure it is to meet you! Any family of Applejack’s is a friend of mine,” Pulling away, Roz slowly batted her eyelashes at Johnny. “Especially when he is so handsome.”</p><p>“Uh… thanks. Roz, was it?” </p><p>“Mhmm. My full name is Natalia Rozmanov, but most people stick with Roz.” She blew him a kiss that made his heart beat a little faster. “I’m participating in the college’s foreign exchange program in order to become a professional baker.” Idly, she plucked at Johnny’s shirt. “Aren’t you uncomfortable in that outfit? <i>Bohze moy</i>! It is only morning and I am already sweaty.” </p><p>Mac coughed. “Leave him be, Roz. Johnny prefers ta wear clothes.”</p><p>Roz pouted and stuck out her lip. “I am simply being friendly, Macintosh.”</p><p>The big man chuckled, “Regardless, we’re in need o’ yer tastebuds.” He waved his hand towards the half-full mason jar. </p><p>Clapping her hands together, Roz sauntered over to the keg in a way that was both innocent and distractingly sexy at the same time. Johnny felt the stirring of an erection press up against the fly of his track pants and did his best to make some discreet adjustments. Seemingly oblivious, Roz wiggled her hips as she held the mason jar up and examined the cider. </p><p>“Such a beautiful golden color. You are from Manehattan, da?”</p><p>Johnny once again, had to tear his eyes away from Roz’s voluptuous form, “Yeah.” </p><p>Roz nodded as she turned around, “Beautiful city but too busy. You were a moonshiner there?”</p><p>“Not exactly,” Johnny chuckled. “Mixologist. I know how party drinks taste, so I figured I might be able to help the family expand into them.”</p><p>“I happen to like men who are ambitious,” Roz mused as she raised the mason jar to her lips. “<i>Na Zdorovie</i>!” Johnny’s eyes widened as the Russian began to chug down the apple cider like it was juice. After polishing off the entire jar, she belched aloud without the slightest hesitation.  </p><p>Nervous, Johnny tried to act as nonchalant as possible. “What do you think?”</p><p>“The cider is decent enough,” Roz remarked, sniffing the remaining liquid. “But a little dry for my taste. I would prefer it to be sweeter. The brew has a nice bite to it though. Which batch is this?” </p><p>“First, actually,” Johnny replied, puffing out his chest. </p><p>“Most impressive~” The pale naturist remarked as she sat down in an old recliner. While she rested her arms atop the edges, Roz lifted her leg, bent her knee, and pressed her foot against her thigh. This gave Johnny an unobstructed view of Roz’s salmon pink folds and the silver stud piercing just below her clit. “Do you enjoy making cider? Is this your passion in life?”  </p><p>Johnny expected Roz to be annoyed. Instead, a sultry smile spread across her lips. “What?”</p><p>“The activity that you enjoy doing the most. Did I not use the correct word in English?” </p><p>“<b>OH</b>! Yeah, I like making cider. It’s hard work but satisfying nonetheless,” Roz hummed in appreciation and adjusted the position of her legs, giving Johnny another peek at what was nestled in-between them. “Sorry if I seem a bit distracted, it’s just that... ”</p><p>Roz’s grin became even wider after she licked her lips. Her eyes drifted downwards and Johnny realized, much to his horror, that the bulge in his track pants had become obvious. “I know precisely what distracts you, Johnny. After all, I would not have gotten a piercing near my nubby if I didn’t want other people to see it. Do you like the way my hair looks? I put a lot of effort into grooming and taking care of my body, I’ll have you know.” </p><p>“I think… I’ll just go get us some water. <i>BE RIGHT BACK</i>!” Johnny squeaked. Beating as dignified a retreat as he could, Johnny awkwardly waddled out of the room. </p><hr/><p>Roz giggled-snorted as she watched Johnny leave in a hurry, desperately trying to hide his erection. Lowering her leg, the curvy goth called out, “Make sure to put some ice in the glass for me, Johnny!” When Roz got up from the recliner, she found herself face to chest with Mac. </p><p>“Mind explainin’ what the hell all that was about, Roz?” The big man rumbled. </p><p>Patting Mac’s chest and marvelling at the firmness of his muscles, she replied, “Whatever do you mean, my burly, ginger-haired friend?”</p><p>“Yer innocent act doesn’t fool me! Ah know ya were flashin’ yer bits at him on purpose!” </p><p>“Please, calm down, Macintosh. I was merely expressing my interest in Johnny,” Roz shrugged. “Also, I wished to confirm that he was not a homosexual. There was an incident at the college during one of our art sessions with Sandalwood and his boyfriend. I had to be certain!” </p><p>Macintosh groaned. “He definitely ain’t gay.” </p><p>Roz hopped in place and clapped her hands together, causing her bountiful breasts to bounce around as she did so. “Excellent! Is he… single, by chance?” </p><p>“So far as Ah know. Why do ya ask?”</p><p>“I meant what I said before. Johnny is the type of man I like and I won’t let another Apple slip through my fingers this time!” Roz’s pale skin took on a decidedly rosy hue. She cursed her chatterbox nature as Mac’s eyebrows approached his hairline. “I was interested in dating you, but that school teacher snatched you up! In any case, I am happy for the both of you.” </p><p>The tall man sighed. “Johnny’s had a rough life up until recently. Ah don’t know if he’s interested in startin’ a relationship right now. Could ya at least try ta be a bit more subtle with yer advances? Bein’ around nekkid ladies ain’t easy fer someone who ain’t a naturist.”   </p><p>Roz crossed her arms underneath her breasts and huffed. “<i>Nyet</i>! I cannot agree to your request. Nothing would ever happen if I let Johnny try to woo me instead. Go on, laugh at my lack of subtlety if you must. But I do not regret what I did. I will not apologize either!”  </p><p>“Ah ain’t asking ya to apologize. Just be more gentle n’ understandin’ with Johnny,” Mac rubbed his face. “Reckon ya can manage that?”</p><p>“I will consider what you have said,” Roz offered in a way that she thought was quite gracious. While she’d never admit it directly to his face, Mac did have a point.</p><p>The two naturists left the distillery together. Roz stretched out her arms and arched her back, enjoying the sensation of sunlight warming her bare skin. While she would always have a soft spot for Mother Russia, Roz adored the constant, balmy weather in Ponyville. She was able to spend far more time enjoying the outdoors in her birthday suit here than at her father’s dacha, which was only warm enough during the summer months. </p><p>A few minutes later, Johnny emerged from the farmhouse with a still slightly flustered expression. While the prominent bulge in his pants had since receded, Roz was well-aware that he continued to observe her curvaceous body with rapt attention. After making a brief apology, he handed her a cup of water with a few ice cubes floating around. Roz gave a happy little moan of appreciation as the cool water chased away the spicy-sweet tang of alcohol. Mac rolled his eyes as he entered the farm house, muttering something about getting his own drink. </p><p>Roz looked directly into his eyes. “Have you ever tried <i>Sharlotka</i>? It is a traditional cake from my home country. Made with apples, of course! I have a feeling that you will like it.” </p><p>The young man’s embarrassment receded as he blinked in confusion, “Can’t say that I have. Why do you ask?”</p><p>“After you so graciously allowed me to taste something crafted by the sweat of your labor,” She grasped his free hand and rubbed it affectionately with her thumb. His hands had a soft suppleness that she found endearing. “I figured that I might as well return the favor.”</p><p>“I’m sure if you wanted to bring something by we could-”</p><p>“<i>Nyet</i>. I am asking you out on a date, Johnny Apple-Seed. Does dinner at my apartment followed by a personal baking lesson sound fun?” Roz gave Johnny her best seductive smile and fluttered her eyelashes at him. </p><p>Johnny took a deep gulp of his water. “We’ve only just met and you’re already asking me out?” </p><p>“Why not? There is no reason for me to ‘<i>beat around the bush</i>’ I believe the expression goes. I like you and want to get to know you better.” Roz moved in closer, making sure to squish her breast against Johnny’s arm. “I promise, my hospitality will not disappoint you in any way~” </p><p>“I’d be crazy to turn down such a cute girl, right?” Johnny admitted with a blush. </p><p>“You would,” Roz agreed with a wide smile. “Does a gathering at the end of the week sound good? I live at the Paradise Palms Luxury Living Complex downtown.” </p><p>Johnny whistled. “Hot damn! That’s where all the rich people live. Are you secretly part of the Russian Royal Family or… ?” </p><p>Giggling, Roz waved her free hand dismissively, “Don’t be ridiculous, Johnny! Papa simply likes to dote on me. I am his one and only child, you see. No big deal! I am still just a normal girl.” </p><p>“I guess it’s a date then,” Johnny replied with an awkward chuckle, raising his glass. “To new friendships!”</p><p>Roz clinked her own glass against his. “With benefits!”</p><hr/><p>Johnny’s hair was still wet from the shower as he compared shirts in front of his mirror. The end of the week had come faster than he’d expected and in an hour he’d be on his first date in a very long time. To say he was nervous was an understatement. While in front of the mirror, he switched between a plaid shirt and a silky purple shirt he’d picked up for clubbing.  </p><p>“Which one, damn it?” Johnny grumbled. “Humble and rustic or sophisticated and flashy?!” </p><p>Babs looked up at him while she was reclining on his bed. The teenager was completely nude, as usual, and had been idly flipping through one of her favorite comics. Babs clicked her tongue and remarked, “Roz doesn’t care about fashion, dude. Just pick somethin’ and go with it.” </p><p>Turning around, Johnny shot his sister a glare. “First impressions matter, sis!”</p><p>“She strikes me as the kind of gal who cares more about the candybar than the wrapper it comes in,” His sister replied. “Why not show off a bit of skin? You’ve got a decent physique.”</p><p>“Ditch the plaid then?” He asked, holding it up.</p><p>Babs rolled her eyes. “Duh! Let Mac have the farmboy look. That ain’t you.” </p><p>Tossing the shirt away, Johnny slid the silky purple shirt on instead, “Do you think my hair is ok tied in  a ponytail or should I put some gel in there and comb it back?”</p><p>After several minutes of what Babs called “<i>preening like a peacock</i>”, Johnny finally felt ready. He’d kept his hair tied back in its usual ponytail and made sure to trim his beard. He kept the shirt unbuttoned down to his pecs, and wore a pair of simple black chinos to finish the outfit, along with matching black dress shoes. As he checked himself out, AJ opened the door. </p><p>“Lookie here! Somebody's feelin’ fancy tonight,” She said by way of greeting. </p><p>“I keep telling him that Roz would rather see him outta those clothes instead,” Babs retorted. </p><p>Applejack chuckled, “She ain’t the least bit subtle, that’s fer sure.” She shot Johnny a smile as she walked up to him and straightened his collar. “Ah reckon she’ll appreciate the effort though.” </p><p>“Thanks,” Johnny let out a sigh. “I hope it’s not too weird that I’m dating one of your friends.”</p><p>“Can’t be any worse than Mac datin’ Bloom’s teacher.” The two laughed before AJ’s face turned serious. “Johnny, there’s somethin’ ya oughta know about Roz.”</p><p>Johnny grinned crookedly, “What? Is she some kind of criminal?”</p><p>“Not exactly,” Applejack bit her lip. “When Ah visited her uncle’s resort, Ah realized that her daddy is a big fish in the Russian Mafia.” Johnny felt his heart sink like a stone, but allowed Applejack to continue. “Roz is ignorant of the whole situation, but I figured ya should know.” </p><p>For several seconds Johnny processed the news before looking his cousin in the eye. “We can’t choose what our parents do, AJ. Babs and I know that all too well. I’d like to get to know Roz better, regardless of what the family business is… or her involvement in their affairs.”  </p><p>The blonde farmer nodded, “Good. Roz might git on mah nerves from time ta time, but she’s a sweetheart. I’d kick yer ass into next week if ya stood her up.” Glancing at the clock she remarked, “Best be on yer way, Johnny. Wouldn’t wanna be late on yer first date.” </p><hr/><p>It took about a half hour for Johnny to reach Roz’s apartment. Little by little, the countryside faded away and was replaced by buildings and concrete. Before long, he was in the affluent part of town, pulling into the parking garage next to Paradise Palms Luxury Living Complex. </p><p>True to its namesake, the apartment building was certainly grand and luxurious. Two palm trees flanked the main entrance which mimicked the architecture of ancient Greece. As Johnny walked into the lobby, he whistled at the sight of a fountain stocked with koi fish swimming in lazy circles at its center. After giving his name to the receptionist on duty, Johnny stared into the fountain as he waited to be escorted up to Roz’s suite. </p><p>After a few minutes of nervously waiting, a gruff Russian voice cleared its throat behind him. “Mr. Apple-Seed?” Turning around, Johnny quailed at the sight of its owner. Bald, brooding and broad-shouldered, the man before him seemed like a bear stuffed into a suit. “Miss Rozanov is ready to see you.”</p><p>“Thank you, Mr…?”</p><p>“Call me Boris,” Boris replied flatly. “Come.” </p><p>What followed was the longest, most nerve-wracking elevator ride of Johnny’s life. The entire time Boris simply glowered at him and made no effort to hide the slight bulge underneath his armpit that Johnny figured was a gun. As they reached the top floor, Boris wordlessly adjusted Johnny’s collar and patted his cheek. “Penthouse, straight ahead. Treat her right or I will snap you in half like a little twig. Have fun.”</p><p>“Duly noted.” Johnny replied, rubbing his stinging cheek as he stepped from the elevator. Boris crossed his arms and nodded at him as the door to the elevator closed behind him. Exhaling heavily, Johnny began walking towards the door and muttered. “Well, that happened. I’m just glad that my underwear is still clean.” </p><p>As Johnny’s approached the penthouse, evidence of Roz’s habitation became clear. The door was decorated with stickers of cakes, cookies and other baked goods as well as a hand painted sign in Russian that he couldn’t decipher. Through the walls the pulsing beat of techno music made him begin tapping his toe as he walked up and rapped his knuckles on the door. </p><p>“Come in Johnny!” Roz’s singsong voice echoed from inside the apartment. “Make sure to take your shoes off at the door… and anything else. Whatever is most comfortable for you!” </p><p>Shaking his head, Johnny opened the door and stepped into a small foyer. Along one side of the wall was a rack containing half a dozen pairs of women’s shoes. As he removed his own, Johnny noted flip flops, combat boots, high heels and simple sneakers, almost all in black. </p><p>Walking down the hall towards the sound of music, Johnny pushed open a door into the living room. He had a brief impression of an open space furnished with leather couches, a wide screen TV, and several life sketches of nude models. To one side, he noted a gleaming kitchen while the opposite side had two sliding glass doors that led to a balcony outside. </p><p>Johnny soon forgot about the scenery when he spotted his date. Roz was on her hands and knees facing away from him, rump raised high into the air as she leaned forward and pressed her breasts against a green yoga mat with her arms stretched forward. Her provocative pose left nothing to the imagination and solicited an immediate reaction from Johnny’s lower half. He tried his best to act nonchalant while cupping his hands over the bulge that had formed in his pants.</p><p>“Johnny! You have finally arrived!” Roz exclaimed with excitement, seemingly unconcerned about exposing her backside to the young man standing directly behind her. </p><p>“Am I interrupting your yoga session?”Johnny muttered before flushing bright red.</p><p>Roz straightened out her legs behind her, while clenching her butt cheeks together. She then proceeded to arch her upper half back, hands splayed apart, while her breasts jutted forward slightly. Johnny coughed, unaware that a curvy girl like Roz could be so flexible.  “<i>Nyet</i>! You simply caught me at the end of my routine. These Indian Yogis sure know a thing or two about flexibility.” After assuming the cobra pose, she sighed. “You were able to find my apartment?”</p><p>Johnny left the doorway and tried to walk around in order to face her. As he did, Roz nimbly rolled over and sat up with her legs crossed. “Yeah. Boris directed me here.”</p><p>Grabbing her right leg and grunting, Roz did her best to lift it behind her head. The results were somewhat mixed as she hunched over, squeezing her breasts together while the pose itself allowed Johnny to notice she’d swapped her clit stud for a silver ring with an amethyst embedded in the center. Puffing, Roz replied, “Boris is my driver and has always been very protective. He can be overbearing sometimes, but he means well. He is a good man, Johnny.” </p><p>With a girlish grunt, Roz lowered her leg and then rolled onto her feet. Sauntering over to Johnny, she placed her hand on his shirt and felt the fabric. “You dressed up for the occasion.” Johnny tensed as she leant forward and kissed his cheek, praying that she didn’t notice the semi-turgid erection pressing up against his fly. Tonight was going to be a test of self control. </p><hr/><p>Roz had to stifle a giggle as her hand ‘<i>accidentally</i>’ brushed up against the not-so-little bulge in Johnny’s pants. As she’d hoped, the young man had become excited by her perfectly timed yoga session. While it was a shame that he was <i>WAY</i> overdressed for their date, Roz had to admit that he looked handsome and cleaned up well. </p><p>Squatting down on her haunches to roll up her yoga mat, Roz asked. “Hungry yet?” </p><p>“Sure am. What’s for dinner?” Johnny adjusted his pants while he thought she wasn’t looking. “Some type of caviar or borsch maybe?”</p><p>“Why does everyone think we Russians only eat those things? I don’t even like caviar.” Leaning her mat against the wall, Roz turned and clapped her hands together. “We are having TACOS!”</p><p>Her date blinked slowly. “What?”</p><p>“I love food from all over the world.” Grabbing his hand, Roz began to lead him to her patio. “Besides, there is nothing like authentic tacos! They’re so flavorful and spicy.” </p><p>“I guess that makes sense. Why are we going outside?” Johnny dragged his heels as Roz reached for the door handle. Turning to regard her date, who was once more blushing like a russet apple, she raised an eyebrow. “Shouldn’t you at least put on a robe?” </p><p>Ignoring his concern, Roz pushed ahead. “Our food is sitting on the patio table and it’s starting to get cold. Besides, we’ll miss viewing the sunset if we wait any longer.”</p><p>Johnny bit his lip. “You really don’t mind if complete strangers see you naked?”</p><p>“You worry too much, Johnny. They’re accustomed to my lifestyle by now.” Roz assured as she playfully poked his chest. “Although, your presence here will surely make the neighbors gossip about us being together. Think of the scandal we shall cause!” Opening the door, she put on her best reassuring smile. “We’ve wasted enough time chatting! Let’s eat!”</p><p>As the cool evening air tickled her skin, Roz shivered in delight. Her father had been sure to purchase a balcony with space enough for a tiny herb garden, a table, and chairs. As an added bonus, she had a breathtaking view of downtown Ponyville and the hilly farmland beyond. </p><p>Johnny whistled as he followed her towards the edge of the balcony. “Hell of a view you’ve got here.” </p><p>“Da. I consider myself very fortunate.” Roz beamed as she skipped over to the table. It was set with a bottle of red wine, a bouquet of roses, and two silver cloches. Taking them off with a flourish, Roz breathed in the smell of tacos with a sigh. “Dinner is served!”</p><p>Heaped on both plates were two soft shell tacos loaded with lettuce, tomatoes, guacamole, beef, and cheese. Beckoning Johnny over, Roz popped the cork on the wine and poured a generous amount into each glass. She giggled when Johnny dragged a chair out for her like a proper gentleman. “Why thank you, good sir.”</p><p>“No problem,” Johnny replied with a smile. Grabbing a towel from the back of the chair, Roz covered the seat with it before sitting down. Scooching her chair forward, she grabbed her glass and took a swig from it as Johnny settled down opposite of her.</p><p>Without a shred of hesitation, Roz began to devour her dinner like a starving prisoner. Johnny was much more polite about eating his own portion, but didn’t comment on his date’s lack of table manners. As one might expect, Roz’s chest was covered in bits of taco afterwards. </p><p>“You’ve got something on your... chest.” Johnny muttered. Roz opened her eyes and smirked as he tentatively nibbled on his own taco, his eyes once more failing to stay forced on his face. </p><p>“My what, Johnny?” Leaning forward, she pressed her breasts together. “Is it on my face? If so, you could always help me lick it clean.”</p><p>“No. It’s all over your--um--boobs.”</p><p>“Ohhh! That makes a lot more sense!” she replied, glancing down at herself as if she’d just noticed. “You can lick those clean too, if you wish. I don’t mind.” Roz smiled innocently, fluttering her eyelashes.  Rather than respond, Johnny blushed and chose to keep eating his taco.</p><p>For several minutes the couple ate in relative silence, exchanging a few pleasantries. Roz studied Johnny’s jaw line and fantasized about what he looked like underneath all of his clothes. If his older cousin was anything to go by, Roz pondered while rubbing her bare thighs together in anticipation, Johnny must surely be hiding something impressive in those jeans.</p><p>Roz blushed when she realized that she was getting a little too carried away with her daydreaming. After taking a moment to adjust herself, the young Russian froze when she noticed Johnny wrinkle his nose with a puzzled look. Clapping her hands to distract him from the damp spot she hoped he hadn’t seen, Roz chuckled. “How is your little sister doing?”</p><p>Johnny raised an eyebrow and replied, “Babs is adjusting pretty well to life in Ponyville, all things considered. She was a nudist even before we moved here, so it’s easier for her than me.” </p><p>“Smart girl. Has she found herself a boyfriend yet?” Roz asked as she dug into her second taco. </p><p>“She’s not… into boys.” He replied with an awkward smile. </p><p>“My apologies, Johnny. I didn’t mean to assume. Has she met anyone special yet?”</p><p>Laughing, Johnny waved his hand dismissively. “Maybe. We’ll just have to wait and see how that turns out. I’m sure it’ll be fine. She’s keen on taking things one step at a time now.”  </p><p>“I always wanted a younger sibling,” Roz sighed wistfully as she looked out towards the setting sun. “Father’s dacha could get so lonely…” </p><p>“I take it you’re an only child?”</p><p>“Mhmm. My parents love having sex, but for some reason, they never had any more children after me,” Roz pouted, sticking her bottom lip out. “Oh, well. It’s not like I can force them to.”</p><p>Unsure how to follow up that little tidbit of information, Johnny offered her a polite shrug. </p><p>“Tell me; is it true what they say about farmers having big families?” Roz shot back while teasing Johnny’s leg with her foot. </p><p>Johnny stiffened, all too aware of how close Roz’s foot was to his crotch. She didn’t push any further, but he still nearly choked on his wine, trying to formulate a response. “Technically, I’m not a farmer. Nor was I raised on one. Born in Manehattan, actually. Please don’t take this the wrong way, but Isn’t it a little early to be discussing kids? This is our first date, for Pete’s sake!”</p><p>Roz stuck her tongue out, “A baker is always eager to have a bun in the oven.” Johnny groaned and rolled his eyes. “What? It’s a good joke! Unless you feel your baguette isn’t up to--”</p><p>“<b>WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET</b>!” Johnny abruptly changed the subject. </p><p>“Even more so, now that I have someone to enjoy it with.” Roz sighed dreamily.</p><p>Scooching her chair around the table, she cuddled up beside Johnny and rested her head on his shoulder. She suppressed a childlike giggle when he took her hand in his own and they sat in comfortable silence, sipping their wine and watching the sun go down. </p><hr/><p>Even as the last of the sunlight slipped beneath the distant mountains Johnny was still feeling pleasantly warm all over. Part of that was the food and drink he’d enjoyed, part of it was the warm summer air but it was mostly due to the naked girl cuddling up against him. Despite his best efforts to calm down, he’d been in a constant state of excitement since he’d entered the apartment and her teasing did little to help matters. </p><p>The young man shuddered as Roz pressed her nose against his neck and inhaled huskily. Sighing she mused, “I expected you to smell like apples. What scent do you use?”</p><p>“Just some cologne I got at the store a while ago.” Johnny replied. “You like it?”</p><p>“Mhmm. There is very little that I don’t like about you so far,” She whispered while unbuttoning his shirt. “These pesky clothes are getting in the way...”</p><p>Grabbing her hand Johnny changed the subject, “You mentioned desert?”</p><p>A flash of irritation crossed her baby blue eyes before the familiar smile came back, “Indeed, I did! Are you prepared to learn one of my favorite recipes?” </p><p>Distracted by her jiggling breasts as she got up from the table, Johnny simply nodded. </p><p>“Good, then follow me! Our Sharlotka awaits!”</p><p>Downing the dregs of his wine, the young man followed her into the kitchen. The moment she stepped into the kitchen, something about Roz’s demeanor changed. She was still as bubbly and bouncy as ever but Johnny noted a certain focused intensity as she plucked her ingredients from a pristinely organized pantry. Before long, Roz had a neat pile of fresh apples, a bag of flour, sugar, vanilla extract, baking powder, and a carton of eggs assembled on her kitchen counter. </p><p>Roz grabbed herself a mixing bowl and a cake pan while she swished her hips from side to side, humming a wordless tune. Johnny smiled as he leaned on the countertop and appreciated the view. The wine had done wonders to get him to relax and his date had made it very clear that she didn’t mind being watched.</p><p>Rising up, she smiled sweetly. “Do you like my buns?” </p><p>“They’re something alright…” Johnny mumbled as she wiggled her rump with a giggle.</p><p>“Good,” Roz beamed as she set the mixing bowl down on the counter. “Did your mother ever teach you how to bake?”</p><p>A pang of sadness gripped Johnny’s chest. “She… wasn’t around enough for stuff like that.” </p><p>Roz bit her lip before clapping her hands. “In that case, I will show you how!”</p><p>Opening the carton of eggs, Roz dexterously plucked one and cracked it with an efficient flourish of her hands. Johnny watched as, in the span of less than a minute, a half dozen eggs were neatly poured into the mixing bowl. Grabbing a whisk, Roz beckoned him over and placed the bowl and whisk in his hands. </p><p>Her breath tickled the back of Johnny’s neck as she hugged him. Her piercings rubbed against his back. Guiding his hand in lazy circles she remarked, “What I need you to do is beat these eggs until they’re all mixed together. Then, add sugar and keep going until I tell you to stop.” </p><p>“Seems simple enough.”</p><p>“Good! I shall prepare the apples!” Roz announced as she stood beside him. Taking a deep breath, Johnny focused on mixing the eggs. As he did, Roz produced a paring knife from the drawer and set about peeling and coring the apples that were sitting atop the counter. </p><p>Roz’s every movement was graceful and efficient when it came to baking. Effortlessly, her knife glided under the skin of each apple, denuding it all in one piece. The core meanwhile was removed with a few simple cuts and discarded into a compost box. By the time Johnny was finally satisfied with the consistency of the batter, Roz had already lined the bottom of the pan with wax paper and preheated the oven.</p><p>“This look good?” Johnny asked, tilting the bowl her way.</p><p>Roz looked up from whisking the flour, baking powder and even more sugar together. “Let me see… very good Johnny! I -oops!”</p><p>Even in his slightly intoxicated state, Johnny could clearly tell Roz had intentionally slipped. The young man grunted as a substantial portion of flour splashed across his shirt and down his pants. Catching herself, Roz put her bowl down and cooed, “Oh no, what a terrible accident! Your clothes are all dirty now!” She stuck her tongue out as she began to unbutton his shirt. </p><p>A sudden flash of anger came over Johnny as he grabbed her hands. “<b>HOLD ON A SECOND</b>!”</p><p>Roz flinched. “It was an accident, I swear!”</p><p>“Don’t give me that crap! I know you’ve been trying to get me naked all night.” Johnny growled, stepping away from her as his frustration bubbled out. “Am I just a quick fuck for you? A means to an end? Because I sure as hell am not going to sit here and be treated like a slab of meat.” </p><p>Roz’s eyes watered as she leant back on the counter. “I-I didn’t mean to...” She swallowed. “Ok. Fine. I obviously think you are very attractive, but I like your personality too! You are sweet, kind, and considerate.”</p><p>Johnny’s anger receded as he placed his hands on her shoulders. “Roz, I like you too. I just want to take a little more time to get to know you better before taking the next step.” He looked away. “Listen, I’m not comfortable with getting naked around you or my family yet. It’s going to take some more time until I reach that point. Until then, can you back off a little?” </p><p>The curvy nudist wiped a tear from her eye, “Da, of course. I’m sorry if I tend to rush into things. When I was growing up in Russia, boys would never ask me out first. I always had to take the lead. Worse yet, they would often ignore me like I was a street urchin begging for change.” Roz smiled sadly. “That is part of the reason why I decided to become a goth. I figured it would set me apart from all of the other blonde girls, and I think dark colors are pretty too.”  </p><p>The two stared at each other in awkward silence for several seconds. Lowering her eyes, Roz mumbled. “If you’d prefer to leave right now, I’d understand. I won’t stop you.”</p><p>After fully unbuttoning his shirt, Johnny removed it and shook all the flour off. “We still need to finish our cake. Do you have an apron I could borrow?”</p><p>A flush colored Roz’s cheeks as she took in Johnny’s upper body. “Let me get it for you!” </p><p>Within a few minutes, Johnny was clad in a soft red apron embroidered with an adorable cartoon bear wearing a ushanka. He and Roz both silently agreed to put their argument behind them as they mixed the dry and wet ingredients together with vanilla extract and finally the apples. After pouring it into the pan, Roz decorated the top with leftover apples and a healthy sprinkling of brown sugar. </p><p>“And now we slide it into the oven!” Roz declared, pulling on a pair of oven mitts. Johnny opened the oven for her as she deposited the cake within. Setting a timer for fifty minutes, Roz removed her oven mitts and stretched. “Would you care to watch a movie while we wait?”</p><p>“Sure,” Johnny replied as he shut the oven. “Got one in mind?”</p><p>Roz was already skipping towards the living room as she called out, “<i>Terror at Twin Pines</i>! It’s an absolutely cheesy exploitation flick from the late seventies! You’ll love it!” </p><p>Shaking his head Johnny followed her and plopped himself down upon her leather couch as she turned her TV on and put the movie on. As the opening credits began, she plopped herself beside him and leant back casually. Taking the hint, Johnny wrapped his arm around her shoulders as the two watched the movie in comfortable silence. </p><p>True to Roz’s promise, Johnny soon found himself laughing along with her at the film. Cheaply made and poorly written, it was clearly a D-film, or a double D-film, Roz would joke. It followed the owner of a nudist resort teaming up with an impossibly busty, buxom Sheriff sporting a bush. They had to defend everyone against a horde of hungry undead. The movie ended with the sheriff and resort owner making out on top of a pile of dead zombies just as the timer chimed. </p><p>Rising from the couch, the two returned to the kitchen and removed their cake from the oven. Both Roz and Johnny sighed as they breathed in the smell of the now golden brown pastry. It reminded Johnny of a mix of Granny Smith’s homemade apple pie and a pound cake. </p><p>Roz took a toothpick and gently pierced the cake’s steaming crust. Nodding at the result, she turned to Johnny, “Cooked all the way through! Not bad for your first time.”</p><p>“I had an exceptional teacher.” Johnny replied with a wink. </p><p>“I always enjoy a bit of flattery now and then.” The Russian giggled as grabbed a knife and began cutting into the cake. After serving them both a large slice, she dug in with her trademark gusto. Johnny followed her example and closed his eyes as the cake touched his tongue. </p><p>Sharlotka had the flavor profile of a buttery pound cake mixed with tart apples and just a hint of brown sugar. It’s texture was dense and fluffy, intermixed with the crunch tartness of the apples. Johnny thoroughly enjoyed it as he scarfed down every crumb. </p><p>While they finished eating, Roz glanced over at Johnny, “Would you like to do this again sometime?” She smiled. “Go out on another date with me, I mean.”</p><p>Taking her hand, Johnny brought it to his lips and kissed it. Roz was every bit the handful his cousins had warned him about but she was endearing in her own unique way once you got to know her. “You know what? I think I’d like that. You can come over to my place next time.”</p><p>Roz bounced up and down in her seat excitedly after she shoved her phone into Johnny’s lap. “Now that you have my phone number, we can chat more often! Just send me a text and let me know when you’d like me to come over to Sweet Apple Acres. I’ll be sure to wear my best outfit!”</p>
