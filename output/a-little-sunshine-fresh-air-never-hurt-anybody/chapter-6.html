		<h1>One Fine Day At The Fine Arts Club</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 6</b></p><p>Sweet Apple Acres, Ponyville </p><p>Applejack awoke at the crack of dawn, as was her habit. This, despite the fact that her classes didn’t begin for another three hours and her daily commute was only a twenty-minute drive. She’d been attending Canterlot University for over a week now and things were going as well as could be expected. Applejack insisted on having all of her classes block-scheduled in the morning, between eight and eleven, so that her schedule would be free during the afternoon. It was a bit grueling to have to endure four courses back to back, but well worth the trouble. </p><p>The amount of homework she got each day, if one could call it that, wasn’t too hateful. At least, not for someone as intelligent and quick-witted as Applejack. Many people assumed that she wasn’t very bright simply because she was a country girl, but nothing could be further from the truth. Big Mac was a self-taught genius when it came to mathematics and logistics even though he hadn’t attended college himself. On many occasions, she’d asked him if he regretted not furthering his formal education. His answer was always a firm, yet resounding “<i>Eenope</i>”.  </p><p>Even so, there were days when Applejack felt guilty about her parents’ death and how much it affected everyone’s lives afterwards. Not so much that she felt personally responsible for their death. That was nothing more than a tragic accident. Plain and simple. Rather, a slew of “<i>what ifs</i>” had she and Big Mac been able to live out the rest of their childhoods without having to worry about the responsibility of raising a younger sibling and managing a farm.  </p><p>She didn’t regret her current path in life, however. Apple Bloom meant the world to the both of them. To see her enjoying the childhood they had cut short was enough reward in and of itself. With a long yawn, Applejack smiled to herself while she looked out the window, surveying the north orchard. It was shaping up to be another beautiful day in Ponyville. After a round of early morning stretches, Applejack padded into the shower and began lathering up her tanned skin with the feminine equivalent of all-purpose body wash and squirted a glob of shampoo into her hair as well. The hot water helped focus her thoughts. </p><p>Satisfied that she had washed away the previous day’s sweat and grime, Applejack toweled off and gave herself a once-over in the mirror. Her physique, lithe, muscled, and dotted with freckles was much the same as it had been ever since she’d matured into a woman. Puberty had been like a bullet train. It hit her hard and fast. By the looks of it, Apple Bloom was already well on her way to becoming a young lady. Apple Family genes at work, as Granny often liked to say. </p><p>Applejack ran her fingers through the silky blonde tuft of hair nestled in-between her legs and frowned. “Should Ah spruce up a bit? Rarity goes on fer days about keepin’ her privates prim n’ proper like but… Ah dunno. Just doesn’t seem right ta me.”</p><p>In an uncharacteristic show of self-doubt, Applejack questioned her decision to model for Canterlot University’s Fine Arts Club. A few days earlier, during their initial briefing, Sandalwood had assured Applejack that she would be shown the utmost respect by all those in attendance. She was quite comfortable being nude around her family but doing so in front of a dozen strangers, whose sole intent was to observe every nook and cranny of—well—everything for two hours and make detailed drawings? Completely different. The blonde farmer wasn’t too keen on the idea of everyone appraising her body like some thoroughbred dog.  </p><p>Applejack scoffed at her reflection. “Ah ain’t there ta put on a peep show fer all o’ them artists. They’ll just have ta suck it up n’ deal with the way Ah am. Freckles n’ all. Gonna be a cold day in hell before Ah git one o’ them bikini waxes Rares was harpin’ on ‘bout. Don’t so much mind the idea o’ visitin’ the spa with her every so often but goin’ full-on smoothie ain’t fer a country gal like me. Ha! Jokes on ya, Rares. Ah don’t even own a bikini!”  </p><p>The only hair she would pay any mind to was the golden locks atop her head. It was somewhat of a hassle, but Applejack decided that styling it into a bun would be the most practical thing to do. A simple ponytail worked when you were out and about, but caused problems if you were standing still or sitting for an extended period of time. Tickled and itched like the dickens. Besides, it would give Applejack the chance to wear that fancy, jeweled hair pin her Aunt Orange had given her during her “<i>sabbatical</i>” in Manehatten a few years prior. </p><p>Speaking of Aunt Orange, a beautiful sundress of her namesake hung, unworn, within the dark recesses of Applejack’s closet. She’d known that her niece was an ardent naturist, and by extension, the rest of the Ponyville clan but that hadn’t stopped her from commissioning it. Aunt Orange was of the (<i>mistaken</i>) impression that Applejack could be molded into the perfect Manehattenite. With proper training, attire, and etiquette lessons, of course. </p><p>Applejack ultimately wound up going back to Sweet Apple Acres and chose the life of a farmer instead of a cultured heiress, but Aunt Orange let her keep the dress as a gesture of goodwill. For a long time, she considered just donating the blasted thing to charity. Yet, Applejack never could bring herself to do so. It was a symbol of Aunt Orange’s misguided, but well-intentioned, affection. She genuinely cared about her niece. Almost like a surrogate daughter that she and her husband could never produce on their own…</p><p>Applejack laid out the dress on top of her bed. She took a moment to admire its craftsmanship, despite her general animosity towards wearing clothing of any kind. “If Ah intend ta gussy up mah hair, might as well put on a pretty dress ta go with it. In any case, it’s supposed ta be hot outside today. Good ta feel the breeze between mah knees if Ah can help it.” </p><p>She left the dress on her bed while she fixed her hair. Putting it on wasn’t strictly necessary for another two and a half hours. Until then, she would stick to her birthday suit. When Applejack finally finished applying the hairpin, she looked at her reflection once more and nodded. The only thing left to do was put on some skin cream, deodorant, and a few dabs of her favorite perfume. Strictly speaking, the bodywash would probably have sufficed but Applejack wanted to make damn certain that she smelled nice for everyone in the club (<i>it was important to make a good first impression</i>). The bodywash had a tendency to wear off after a few hours anyway. </p><p>Much to Applejack’s chagrin, the rest of her family was already sitting at the table, enjoying breakfast of pancakes, bacon, and sautéed apples when she approached the dining room. They all stopped their conversation when she went to pour herself a cup of coffee. Upon grabbing her own plate of chow, Applejack began cutting into her stack of pancakes slowly, gaging everyone else’s reaction. What felt like an eternity of awkward silence and chewing was only broken by her little sister’s voracious curiosity. The teenager grinned while nibbling on a strip of bacon. </p><p>“Ya did yer hair up all fancy today, AJ. What’s the occasion? Ya got a date or somethin’?” </p><p>Applejack shifted in her seat with a slight blush. “Fer yer information, I’m gonna be headin’ on over ta the Art Club after all mah classes are finished today. Thought I’d make a good first impression. Not that it’s any business o’ yers, ‘Bloom.” </p><p>Granny cocked her brow. “Is that so, sugarcube? Didn’t think you’d ever bother wearin’ that gaudy thing. Must’ve cost Valencia a pretty penny. It’s a wonder ya never tried to sell it.” </p><p>Applejack poked one of the pancakes with her fork. “Well—um—it’s got sentimental value.” </p><p>Mac sighed. “Granny, please don’t tease her too much ‘bout it. The Oranges are still kin.” </p><p>“Ah know that, Macky. Reckon they could try a bit harder ta visit us is all…” Granny remarked. </p><p>Applejack took a swig of her coffee. “Ah still talk with Auntie Orange from time ta time.” </p><p>“Good fer ya, then. Far as I’m concerned, they’d rather keep ta themselves in Manehatten than admit we even exist. Bunch o’ snobs. They’re embarrassed that we don’t wear clothes n’ such. Think we’re nothin’ but backwards hicks, rollin’ around in the dirt nekkid.” </p><p>Applejack grimaced. “Yeah, I’ll admit that it was a sore subject back when Ah was stayin’ with ‘em. They tried to git me ta wear all o’ them fancy duds n’ jewelry all the time. That’s when Ah realized that the high life wasn’t all it was cracked up ta be.”</p><p>Apple Bloom reached over and squeezed her sister’s hand. “I’m glad ya decided ta come back. Sweet Apple Acres just wouldn’t be the same without ya.” </p><p>Applejack laughed and kissed Apple Bloom’s cheek. “Thanks. Glad ta be here.” </p><p>Winona barked a few times and nudged Applejack’s leg underneath the table. </p><p>“Oh, alright. You’ll git some bacon, Ah promise.” </p><p>While the happy border collie munched on her meaty treat, Big Mac put down the morning paper and looked over at his younger sister. The wheels began turning in his head, as oft they did, and he wondered why Applejack hadn’t elaborated further on what she would be doing at the art club. After all, he’d never see her paint or draw anything beyond simple doodles. Why get into those hobbies now? For the time being, he decided not to press Applejack any further. </p><p>Big Mac finished his coffee and stood up. “Guess Ah ought ta git started on the newest batch o’ whiskey. C’mon, Winona. We’re goin’ out ta the stills. Later, y’all.” </p><p>After Mac closed the door, Apple Bloom scooted closer to Applejack and whispered in her ear. “Are ya sure it’s just a visit ta the Arts Club? Yer wearin’ perfume too.”</p><p>Applejack rolled her eyes. “That’s all it is, miss nosey-neighbor.” </p><p>“Whatever ya say, AJ. I’ve got some homework ta finish up, so I’ll be goin’ now.” </p><p>Granny waved to her youngest grandchild while she padded up the stairs towards her room. “Ah find yer behavior a might peculiar, sugarcube. But who am Ah ta judge? At the very least, yer puttin’ yerself out there and meetin’ folks. A step in the right direction, Ah suppose.” </p><p>“When did everyone git so dang interested in mah personal life?” Applejack grumbled. </p><p>Granny laughed. “Because ya finally have one!”</p><hr/><p>Applejack let out a tired sigh as she exited her economics class. Doing work on the farm was one kind of exhausting, but sitting through four classes in a row was on another level entirely. Her stomach growled in protest because it had been nearly six hours since she’d last filled her belly with any food. That was the farmer’s life for you: early to rise, early to bed, early to eat. Applejack checked her phone absentmindedly, waiting for a text from Rarity. It came not but a moment later. She didn’t seem to have any classes going on at the moment. Applejack grinned. </p><blockquote><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#5E51A3">An early luncheon sounds like a splendid idea, darling~ You can’t very well model on an empty stomach! That said, I’m not a big fan of the school café but it shall have to do. We don’t have enough time to go anywhere more substantial before the session begins, I’m afraid. </span>😔</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#E97135">Not to worry, Rares. I ain’t picky when it comes to chow.</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#E97135"> </span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#5E51A3">Still, I feel like we should have a girl’s night out sometime. I’d like to treat you to something special, Applejack. There’s an excellent sushi place in town called: “The Prickly Pufferfish”. 🍣 Despite the quirky name, it is a reputable establishment, I assure you. </span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#E97135">Wasn’t worried about that. When do you want to meet up? </span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#5E51A3">A quarter after eleven sounds perfect. Ta ta for now, dear~ </span>👋</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#E97135">Later. </span></p></blockquote><p>If there was one thing that Applejack noticed differently from her typical collegiate experience, was that more people seemed to notice her. Like, substantially more. It got to the point where she had to tell a few, overly forward fellers to back off with the flirting. The blonde farmer supposed it had to do with her fancy getup. Even without lipstick, eyeshadow, or makeup, it gave her an easily recognizable air of sophistication and grace that jean shorts couldn’t provide. She paused for a moment and contemplated if the key to making more friends was just looking sexy and rich. </p><p>“Might nab me some fanboys in the short term but nothin’ substantial.” Applejack muttered. </p><p>Thankfully, her journey to the café was a short one. The econ wing was directly across from it. Rarity texted her again and apologized for taking longer than expected to arrive. Apparently, she had a makeup emergency and needed to “<i>freshen up</i>” in the ladies’ room. Applejack snorted. Typical frou-frou fashionista, worrying about how much lipstick she’s got on or whatever. About ten minutes later, Rarity showed up slightly out of breath and late.</p><p>Applejack raised her brow. “What took ya so damned long?” </p><p>“My apologies, dear. You wouldn’t believe what this dreadful humidity does to my hair—OH MY GOODNESS!  What a fabulous dress! Who designed it?! <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">I MUST KNOW</span>!!” </p><p>Applejack blushed at her friend’s sudden outburst. “Quiet down, will ya? It ain’t that big o’ a deal. Just some… dress that mah Auntie Orange commissioned.” </p><p>“Wait. You can’t possibly mean <b>THE</b> Valencia Orange? As in the tropical fruit mogul and humanitarian?” Rarity asked excitedly. </p><p>“Yeah, she’s family all right. We ain’t super close, though. Ah stayed with her and mah uncle at their mansion in Manehatten a few years ago. Got a taste o’ the high life while Ah was there, Ah guess. Didn’t much care fer it. I’m a country gal at heart. Always have been.” </p><p>Rarity squealed. “That’s simply astounding! I had no idea you were related to them.”</p><p>Applejack rubbed the back of her neck. “Look, can we just go get somethin’ ta eat already?” </p><p>“Ah, yes. Where are my manners? You must be famished! We can chat later.” </p><p>One turkey club sandwich later, Applejack sat at the table and took a sip from her large iced tea to help wash it all down. Rarity stuck with a cranberry chicken salad, claiming that she was watching what she ate. In Applejack’s humble opinion, she was already slim and attractive. In fact, Rarity could have stood to put on a few extra pounds. But that was her business. Applejack didn’t much care for conversation while she ate, unlike Rarity. Therefore, it was a fairly one-sided conversation for about fifteen minutes. At one point, she had to shoo the Fashionista away when she tried to get a better look at the hair pin. </p><p>Rarity let out a dreamy sigh. “Those are real rubies, you know.”</p><p>“So, what if they are? Ah rarely take this thing outta the box.” </p><p>Rarity huffed. “I can’t believe you, Applejack. Your aunt bought you such a beautiful, not to mention, valuable gift and you treat it like it’s nothing. Shame! Shame, I tell you!” </p><p>Applejack rolled her eyes after making a loud slurping noise with her straw. “Ah told ya before, Rares. Fancy jewelry n’ duds ain’t fer me. I like ta keep things simple. Most o’ the time that means nothin’ but mah Stetson n’ a scrunchie. Ya should know that about me by now.”  </p><p>Rarity snorted. “<i>Au Naturale</i> is about as simple as one can get. In any case, I think you should try to make more of a concerted effort to present yourself, Applejack. As I said before, you are quite beautiful. Even without the aid of cosmetics. All it takes is just a little enhancement here and there. Nothing terribly flashy. You’re not going to get a boyfriend by wearing flannel.” </p><p>“Ain’t mah fault that pretty dresses don’t hold when yer workin’ on the farm.” </p><p>Rarity took a sip of her blueberry-cucumber kombucha and waved her hand dismissively. “Of course, not. All I’m suggesting is that when you are <i>away</i> from the farm, that you dress appropriately for social outings, not slopping the hogs. Is that so much to ask?” </p><p>“That reminds me. Ah gotta git more feed fer Curly. Should Ah go with corn mush or—”</p><p>Rarity groaned in frustration. “How should I know? I’m not a farmer. Ugh! I can’t believe we’re talking about pigs of all things. What’s next? Bumper crops? Rain tables? <b>NO</b>! Don’t… actually answer either of those questions, Applejack. I was being facetious.” </p><p>The blonde famer blushed. “Oh—erm—right. Sorry, Rares. Guess Ah ain’t good at small talk.” </p><p>“Yes, I can see that. No matter. I am willing to bring you to speed if you so desire.” </p><p>“On what exactly?” Applejack inquired. </p><p>“Well, you know. All sorts of things. Fashion trends, popular music, avant-garde art.”</p><p>Applejack frowned. “No offence, Rares but… none o’ that sounds interestin’ ta me.” </p><p>“It’s not about whether you think they’re interesting or not.”</p><p>“Then what’s the point?” </p><p>Rarity sighed. “I admire your honesty, darling but with it comes naiveté. Hmm. Well, I suppose it’s all part of your down-to-earth, country girl charm. The point is: if you’re knowledgeable about various topics, it will make you seem more well-rounded during casual conversations.” </p><p>“Reckon that makes sense.” Applejack agreed half-heartedly. </p><p>Rarity twirled a piece of grilled chicken with a fork. “Alas, Rome was not built in a day. Perhaps later we can converse about how to make you more—ah—culturally rounded later. For now, I’d rather enjoy my lunch in peace. Does that sound fair to you?”</p><p>Applejack simply nodded and continued to munch on her sandwich. She wasn’t sure why Rarity was all bent out of shape over stuff like paintings but it must have been important to her. Out of the corner of her eye, she spotted someone walking towards the table that she hadn’t seen since summer. It was Haki. He apparently had noticed Applejack at the same time and they both flashed each other a somewhat awkward grin. Smelling blood in the water, Rarity took the opportunity to wave him over to sit down with them. The aspiring botanist obliged. </p><p>Rarity fluttered her eyelashes. “Who is this handsome fellow, Applejack?” </p><p>“Haki. Heard him mention that he was attendin’ classes at CU.” </p><p>Rarity chortled and offered her hand. Haki shook it hesitantly. “A pleasure to meet your acquaintance, sir. My name is Rarity Belle, soon to be fashion mogul.”</p><p>Haki chuckled. “Same. I-I mean the acquaintance part. Not the fashion mogul. I’m studying to become a botanist like my aunt. She’s letting me stay with her while I attend college.” </p><p>“Is that so? Awfully generous of her. How, may I ask, did you two become acquainted?” </p><p>Applejack took the lead when Haki hesitated to answer. “His car broke down alongside the road. Ah fixed it fer him. We ate ice cream together, exchanged numbers, and went our separate ways. Heh. I’ve been so busy as of late that Ah forgot ta call or text ya. Sorry, Haki…” </p><p>Haki rubbed his neck. “No, it’s cool. I’ve been busy too.” </p><p>Rarity clapped her hands. “So… what are your plans for the remainder of the day, Haki?” </p><p>“Not too much. Just finished up my classes. I’m off to the Arts Club after lunch. I’ve always been decent at drawing animals and plants but I wanted to try my hand at people. That and—umm—it counts towards my elective credits. Something my aunt suggested.” </p><p>Rarity grinned like a Cheshire cat. “What a coincidence~ Applejack and I were about to do the same. I heard a rumor that today’s model was going to be someone special. Unique, shall we say. What are your thoughts on the subject, Haki?”</p><p>Applejack’s face became pale as a sheet when she realized that Haki was going to be drawing her, along with a dozen or so other strangers. Plus, Rarity. For his part, Haki seemed a little reluctant to answer her friend’s question. “I don’t know. I’ve never actually sat down and drawn a nude model before. It’ll be an… interesting experience, I imagine.” </p><p>“Indeed~ What about you, Applejack? Are you looking forward to the session?” </p><p>The blonde famer nearly choked on her iced tea. “Won’t know ‘till it happens.” </p><p>Haki looked over at her with concern. “Are you ok, Applejack? Sounded like you were choking there for a second.” </p><p>“Nah, I’m fine fer now. Just went down the wrong pipe is all. Thanks, fer askin’.” </p><p>“Is that why you’re going to the session? For extra credits, I mean.” Haki asked. </p><p>“Umm… yeah, ya could say that. I’m not much of an artist, ta be honest.” </p><p>Haki smiled. “Don’t worry about it. Like anything else, drawing takes lots of practice. I’m sure you’ll get the hang of it eventually. Oh, and you could always ask me to help. I’d be more than happy to show you a few pointers some time, if you’re interested.” </p><p>Applejack reached back to play with a strand of her hair, only to realize that it was tied up in a bun. She began tapping her foot against the floor instead. “Uh… maybe? Sounds interestin’.” </p><p>“Cool. I’ll see you girls at the Art Club. Bye!” </p><p>While Applejack waved goodbye, Rarity made sure Haki was out of sight before she scooted closer to her friend and nudged her ribs. “Oh ho~ What have we here? I must admit, Applejack. I wasn’t expecting you to be acquainted with a handsome Zebrican. Do tell me more, darling.” </p><p>Applejack blushed profusely. “There ain’t nothin’ ta tell, Rares. It happened just like Ah said.”</p><p>“I’m sure it did. However, I couldn’t help but notice some chemistry between you two.” </p><p>Applejack shuffled her feet. “Ah think yer readin’ into the situation too deep.” </p><p>Rarity laughed. “No, I don’t believe so~ You’re attracted to Haki, aren’t you?” </p><p>“So, what if Ah am? Ya got a problem with that?” Applejack responded defensively. </p><p>“I knew it! And for the record, I have no problem with it whatsoever. In fact, I’m happy for you, Applejack. You’re long past due for a date. Live it up while you’re still young and beautiful.” </p><p>Applejack bit her lip. “Well, Ah dunno—maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad thing ta git me a boyfriend. But don’t ya dare rush me! Ah wanna take this at mah own pace, ya hear.” </p><p>Rarity scoffed. “Perish the thought, darling. I simply want you to enjoy life. I must say, though, he is quite the specimen of male athleticism. Tall, dark, and handsome. You have excellent taste if I do say so myself.”  </p><p>Applejack fidgeted in her seat. “Yeah, he is pretty good-lookin’. Damn it all! Ah dunno how I’m gonna make it through the session now. He’ll be there, right in the thick o’ it, drawin’ every last detail o’ mah nekkid body. It’ll be awkward as hell…” </p><p>“As a naturist, I would have assumed you were used to displaying some skin, no?” </p><p>Applejack let out a shuddering sigh. “This situation ain’t the same, Rares. Ah can’t really articulate the feelin’ properly, but it’s a helluva lot more nerve-wrackin’ ta be the subject o’ everyone’s attention. Back on the farm, I’m much more comfortable and relaxed. Bein’ nude around mah family ain’t a big deal ta me. Always been that way fer years.” </p><p>Rarity scrunched her lips in thought. “I think I understand. My apologies, Applejack. I was unaware that naturists could feel nervous about showing off their bodies. I just assumed—”</p><p>Applejack leaned back in her seat. “It’s alright, Rares. Ya ain’t a naturist. Ah don’t expect ya to understand how Ah feel. I’m nervous because Haki’s gonna be there more than anythin’ else.” </p><p>Rarity reached over and squeezed Applejack’s hand. “You have nothing be ashamed of, Applejack. I know it sounds cliché, but do try to calm down a bit. When you arrive, project that country girl confidence and poise. I know you can do it! If nothing else, this modeling session will prove, without a doubt, whether Haki’s interested in you as a woman.” </p><hr/><p>Applejack and Rarity arrived at the CUAD building about a half hour before the session was scheduled to begin. For her part, the fashionista insisted on helping her friend prepare, which in Applejack’s opinion, really didn’t amount to much. What else was there to prepare for other than to slip out of her sundress, kick off her sandals, and pose for some artists? After giving it some thought, Applejack conceded that, perhaps, it had more to do with preparing herself mentally for the session rather than physically. Sandalwood ushered them over to an adjoining room.</p><p>“I suppose it’s a bit of a misnomer to call this place a dressing room.” Rarity remarked dryly.   </p><p>Sandalwood chuckled. “Nothing gets past you, eh? Irony aside, this is where we allow our models to relax and freshen up. Oh, and I should mention that it’s perfectly fine if you need to move around a bit during the session. Wouldn’t want your muscles to get sore. Over in the corner is a refreshment station. Everything is GMO-free, organic, and keto friendly.”</p><p>“Uh… beg pardon, but what the hell does all o’ that mean?” </p><p>“It means that all the food and beverages stocked within this room are healthy for you!”</p><p>Applejack scratched her head. “Right. A cup o’ coffee sounds good right now. Need a pick-me-up after lunch. If I’m gonna be sittin’ fer a while, I’d rather not be tempted ta fall asleep.” </p><p>Sandalwood laughed effeminately and clapped his hands together. “What an excellent idea! In particular, the hazelnut fair trade blend is to die for~ I made sure to stock non-dairy creamer in the fridge if you don’t drink—”</p><p>“Thanks, Sandalwood. Ah can handle all the brewin’ and whatnot.” </p><p>Sandalwood nodded. “Just remember, Applejack. I’m here for you. That means, if at any point you start to feel uncomfortable or anxious, please let me know right away. The Fine Arts Club prides itself on creating and maintaining a safe environment for our models. Nude or otherwise.”</p><p>Applejack rubbed her arm. “Appreciate it, Sandalwood. So—um—Ah reckon it’s time ta take mah clothes off and git <i>in the zone</i>. Heh. That sounded a lot cooler in mah head…”</p><p>“Yes, of course. I’ll be out in the classroom getting everything else setup in the meantime. Goodbye ladies, and good luck!”</p><p>Rarity waved as Sandalwood walked out the door. “Well, he’s a bit… overbearing.” </p><p>Applejack snorted. “Like you ain’t sometimes?”</p><p>Rarity rolled her eyes dramatically. “Fair point. In all seriousness, are you alright?” </p><p>Applejack undressed quickly and stowed her belongings in a nearby cubby. “Ready as I’ll ever be, Ah reckon. Won’t know fer sure until Ah sit down and everyone starts drawin’. Hmm. Is it just me or is it a might chilly in here? Guess I’m just used ta bein’ outside in the heat.” </p><p>With a slight blush, Rarity coughed and tried to politely ignore her friend’s erect nipples. “Ah… well, I suppose it is a bit brisk inside the building. Considering how hot it is outside, they probably have the AC on full blast. Perhaps, the coffee will help warm you up?” </p><p>The blonde famer sighed contentedly when she took her first sip. “Gotta say, this here hazelnut blend is pretty damn good. Looks like there’s some other goodies in the fridge, if ya care ta partake. Uh… Rares? What’s wrong? Yer starin’ into space.”</p><p>Rarity bit her lip. “My apologies, Applejack. I was just—observing your body for a moment. Up until now, I never got the chance to admire your beauty up close before. Goodness, me! What I wouldn’t give to have abs like that! Every last inch of you has been sculpted from hard work, sunshine, and what I can only assume to be a rigorous skincare routine. Simply divine~” </p><p>Applejack’s cheeks flushed while she rubbed the back of her neck. “Thanks. It means a lot ta me ta hear ya say that, Rares. Considerin’ how much o’ an expert ya are on such matters. As fer the skin care, Ah take good care o’ mine every mornin’. Little bit o’ cocoa butter n’ shea goes a long way, Ah like ta say. Heh. Rhymes, don’t it?” </p><p>“I couldn’t agree more, darling.”</p><p>Applejack traced a line along the floor with her toes. “Lord almighty. Ah feel more anxious than a rodeo bull all cooped up in his pen. Do ya really think Ah can pull this off? What if Ah make a fool o’ mahself in front o’ everyone. In front o’… Haki? What if he thinks—” </p><p>Rarity placed her hands upon Applejack’s shoulders and squeezed them gently. “Like Sandalwood said, if you want to stop at any point, the option is there. However, I will admit that it would be a shame not to put your beautiful body on display. You are the very definition of a living muse, Applejack. Even now, my creative juices are overflowing and about to burst!”  </p><p>“Hold on a second, Rares. Ya don’t mean—”</p><p>Rarity shook her head vehemently and waved her hands. “I meant in an artistic sense, darling! Not that I don’t find you attractive, of course. Quite the contrary! Oh, drat! Just forget I said that last part, lest we make the situation even more awkward than it already is. <b>MOVING ON</b>!” </p><p>“Does that mean ya bat fer the other team?” Applejack asked hesitantly. </p><p>Rarity sighed and rubbed her forehead. “Not entirely, dear. Let’s just say that I don’t like to limit myself when it comes to appreciating beauty or… paramours and leave it at that.”</p><p>“Oh. Well—um—that’s just fine n’ dandy. Way ta keep an… open mind?” </p><p>“I meant what I said earlier, Applejack. I do find you… <i>considerably attractive</i>. However, I promise that it won’t get in the way of our friendship. For what it’s worth, I’m sorry for ogling you at a time when you’re at your most vulnerable. Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?” </p><p>Applejack decided that a (<i>nude</i>) hug probably wouldn’t be the best thing for Rarity at the moment, so she settled on a friendly shoulder pat instead. “No biggie, Rares. I’m already over it. Ah guess it’s just… weird knowin’ that ya think I’m—uh—sexy. Is that the right word?” </p><p>Rarity let out a girlish giggle and twirled a strand of her hair. It made Applejack feel very uncomfortable. “Quite so~ You see, I’ve always had a bit of thing for strong women who—”</p><p>“Alrighty then,” Applejack interrupted before Rarity could continue, “Lemme finish mah coffee and then we can git this session rollin’. No time like the present, right?”</p><p>After yet another sincere apology, Rarity left the changing room and Applejack quickly followed suit. Most of the other artists had arrived and were setting up their stations. From what Applejack could tell, none of them had any paint, so they were probably going to stick with pencil sketches. In the center of the room was a plain, but comfortable looking couch. During their preliminary meeting, Sandalwood had mentioned that was where she could recline, if she so desired. </p><p>At the moment, Applejack felt far too nervous to sit down or recline. She had to close her eyes for a moment and take in a few deep breaths to try and calm down. It didn’t help much. Despite the chilly atmosphere in the room, her skin became clammy with sweat. She blew out a ragged sigh through pursed lips and smacked her cheeks a few times in order to focus. Once she was thoroughly psyched-up for the task at hand, she stood before everyone and cleared her throat. </p><p>“Howdy, y’all. Mah name’s Applejack. I’m gonna be yer nude model today.” </p><p>Much to her surprise, all Applejack received from the artists were polite greetings and a few nods. However, as she looked around the room, it didn’t escape her notice that Haki was sitting near the left-hand corner with an astonished look on his face. Applejack tried not to let his presence get to her but her tan skin flushed a noticeable, pinkish hue underneath the glow of the ceiling lights and she avoided direct eye contact with him whenever possible. Applejack hoped that her <i>slight</i> omission of the truth wouldn’t ruin the rapport they had going.  </p><p>Sandalwood clapped his hands. “Alright, people! You know the drill. No touching the model, or requests for any lewd or excessively compromising poses. If she asks for a break, we must abide. Am I understood? Excellent! Applejack, you may pose however you prefer. Remember to relax.” </p><p>The blonde farmer crossed her arms underneath her breasts and shuffled her feet. “That’s just it, Sandalwood. Ah don’t know what y’all expect me ta do. Is there… a pose y’all want ta see in particular? Like if Ah flexed mah muscles? Pardon mah ignorance, I’ve never done this before.” </p><p>“It’s quite alright, Applejack. We host plenty of first-timers. Let me put it to you this way: it’s not about what we want, per say, it’s more important for you to do whatever feels natural.” </p><p>“None o’ this feels natural ta me.” Applejack groused.  </p><p>Sandalwood rubbed his chin. “Be that as it may, try imaging that you’re in a different place. Your happy place, to be more precise. After a while, the nervousness will subside and you’ll forget that there’s other people in the room drawing you.” </p><p>“Sounds like yer speakin’ from personal experience.” Applejack remarked. </p><p>“Yes, I’ve modeled plenty of times before. That’s one of the many reasons why I was chosen by the department to lead the Fine Arts Club. Do you have any other questions or concerns? Please tell me now before we begin in earnest.” </p><p>Applejack simply shook her head and walked over to the couch, her bare feet pattering against the tiled floor. She was going to maintain a standing pose initially, but decided that flexing her muscles like some body builder was a bit strange and not to mention, forced. Instead, she took a seat near the center of the couch, spread her legs butterfly style, feet pressed together, and hands resting atop her thighs. She tended to sit this way while underneath the shade of the apple trees when she was taking a break from harvesting. Applejack closed her eyes and imagined the scent of fresh air, grass, and applewood. It brought a smile to her face.  </p><p>When she opened her eyes once more, the blonde farmer noticed that everyone was busy sketching away on their pads. Including, Rarity and Haki. More so on the fashionista’s part. As she had mentioned before, her creative muse was apparently in full swing. She was having one of her infamous “<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">IDEA</span>” moments. Applejack was well-aware that her current pose left nothing to the imagination for her audience but she felt that being shy about revealing certain parts of her body was pointless. They’d get a peek at everything when she changed positions anyway.  </p><p>About thirty minutes passed before Applejack’s muscles began to stiffen. She got up from the couch, excused herself, and decided that taking a quick bathroom break was in order. While she was sitting on the toilet, taking care of business, she heard the door open and close shut. Not expecting anyone else to intrude on her private moment, she tensed up and her heart raced. </p><p>“Who’s there?! The stall’s occupied.” </p><p>“It’s just me, darling. I came in to check on you.” Rarity responded. </p><p>“Could ya have at least waited until Ah was finished empytin’ mah bladder?” </p><p>Rarity let out an awkward chuckle. “Oh—erm—I suppose I could have. My mind is stuck in the zone, as it were. I hadn’t considered your privacy. My apologies, dear.” </p><p>Applejack finished up and wiped herself clean. She then proceeded to wash her hands with soap and hot water. “No worries. Ah was done peein’ anyway. Truth be told, Ah guess this gig ain’t so bad after all. Didn’t git a chance ta peruse everyone’s sketches yet, though.”</p><p>“From what I could tell, most of the sketches I saw managed to capture the quintessential essence of your country girl charm. In particular, Haki’s. His drawing was… quite detailed and accurate, I must say. To put it simply, darling, he was paying rapt attention to you the whole time. Oh ho~ With an adorable blush too. All good signs, in my opinion.”</p><p>Applejack splashed some water on her flushed face. “Well, that’s… good ta know. Hoowee! It’s gonna be one helluva awkward conversation the next time Ah git the chance ta speak with Haki. But… Ah reckon, it’s good fer him ta see me nekkid sooner rather than later. He won’t be so taken back when Ah tell him that I’m a naturist. What do ya think, Rares?” </p><p>Rarity tapped her chin in thought. “I’m not sure, dear. I don’t know Haki well enough to make that judgement call. We’ll just have to wait and see.”</p><p>Applejack let out a long, heavy sigh. “That’s what Ah was afraid ya were gonna say.” </p><p>“Whatever happens, I think you should be forthright about your lifestyle.”</p><p>“Yeah, Ah plan ta tell Haki as soon as Ah git the chance ta sit down and have a conversation with him. Can’t very well found a relationship based on secrets.” </p><p>Rarity nodded in agreement. “Indeed. Best of luck, darling. I’m rooting for you!” </p><p>“Thanks. I’m gonna need it.” Applejack admitted. </p><p>With her bathroom break concluded, Applejack padded back out to the main room and asked everyone how they wanted to proceed. The general consensus was that they’d all gotten plenty of time to sketch her sitting pose and would focus on adding the finishing touches to that rather than starting something new. A slew of complicated feelings raced through Applejack’s mind. On one hand, she was relieved that the session was over. On the other, it meant that she’d need to have her talk with Haki much sooner than expected. Seeing no other alternative, Applejack thanked everyone for their time and patience, then went back to the changing room to put on her clothes. </p><p>Upon exiting the door, Rarity was nowhere to be seen. Thinking fast, Applejack checked her phone to see if her friend had called or anything. Sure enough, an unread text message had been sent while she was still changing. The blonde farmer skimmed it over with an irritated scowl. </p><blockquote><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#5E51A3">I took the liberty of heading back home, so that I could add the finishing touches to my sketch of you in a more private setting, dear. 😙 I hope you don’t mind. Furthermore, I wanted to ensure that you had an opportunity to meet up with Haki on your own. I didn’t want to be a third wheel. </span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#5E51A3">TTL – Rarity </span></p></blockquote><p>Before she had the chance to complain, Haki approached Applejack while she was walking towards the café. Completely taken off guard and unprepared, Applejack struggled to find the right way to start a conversation with him. “Howdy, Haki. Fancy meetin’ ya here.” </p><p>“Hey, AJ. Look… I’m just going to cut straight to the point: why didn’t you tell me that you were going to be the model today? It would have been nice to know that beforehand!” </p><p>Applejack’s cheeks flushed bright red. Partially out of anger but mostly from embarrassment. “Why does it matter what Ah choose ta do in mah spare time? Last Ah checked, it ain’t none o’ yer damn business ta know ahead o’ time if Ah model fer the club or not. Plain n’ simple.” </p><p>“Don’t you understand how awkward that was for me?! AJ, I really do want to get to know you better, but I hate being lied to. What you did was unfair!” Haki argued. </p><p>Applejack growled. “Ya said it yerself. We barely know each other. What was Ah supposed ta say, Haki? Just casually mention that you’d see me buck nekkid in an hour? Ah don’t think so!” </p><p>The two of them stewed in their anger for a minute, neither saying a word to each other. For her part, Applejack eventually realized that her outburst was unwarranted. She hadn’t been completely honest with Haki, even if it was simply an omission of expectations. If Applejack wanted to be more open with her friends, this definitely wasn’t the right way to go about it. Conversely, Haki took a moment to consider Applejack’s side of the equation. Had he been the one nude modeling for the Art Club instead of her, the young athlete conceded that he would have hesitated to tell AJ about it too. </p><p>Haki rubbed the back of his neck. “I’m sorry, AJ. I didn’t mean to strike a nerve. That was thoughtless of me.”</p><p>“I’m sorry too, Haki. Mah temper got the best o’ me. As fer why Ah didn’t say anythin’ before, it’s because Ah was too embarrassed n’ nervous ta tell ya. Ah was afraid of what you’d think o’ me. Sitting up there, with mah body on display, in front o’ everyone ain’t what I’d call a cakewalk. Ah didn’t want ya ta be turned off by it, is what I’m sayin’.” </p><p>Haki grimaced. “I’m not very good at understanding how women think. But I would never think any less of you for volunteering to be a model. It’s good money, from what I hear. I-I mean, so long as you don’t mind a bunch of strangers staring at you for over an hour, that is.” </p><p>Applejack chuckled and played with the end of her hairpin. “Ah gotta admit, the pay was good fer the type o’ work Ah did. Say, Haki. Would ya like ta tag along with me fer a cup o’ coffee n’ chat fer a while? Mah treat.” </p><p>“Really? I didn’t think that you would—yeah, I’d love to!” </p><p>Applejack stuck with a simple medium roast. Cream and no sugar. She didn’t want to go overboard on the caffeine considering that she’d had a cup during the session. As for Haki, he opted for a caramel macchiato. Applejack had never ordered one before but knew that Rarity loved them. It was a bit frou-frou for her tastes. For the first time all afternoon, when she sat down, Applejack didn’t feel like her stomach was going to twist itself into knots. A sense of calm determination washed over her. A one on one conversation was much less daunting than nude modeling in front of a group. She took a swig from her mug and composed herself. </p><p>“Haki, Ah ain’t a gal who likes ta mince words. Nor am Ah particularly skilled at small talk. So, I’ll just git right ta the heart o’ the matter. When we first met along the road durin’ the summer, Ah felt some chemistry between us. Like Ah… wanted ta git ta know ya better.”</p><p>Haki looked down at his cup. “Me too. Is that weird?”</p><p>Applejack shook her head. “Nah, Ah don’t think it is. Would ya mind if we tried datin’? Ah know mah request seems a bit straightforward, but Ah like ya and think yer handsome. Judgin’ by how ya were starin’ at me back in the art room, I’d say yer interested in me that way too.”  </p><p>Despite being dark-skinned, Haki’s blush was intense enough to be noticeable. “You noticed, huh? Uh—damn. I didn’t mean to seem creepy about it. I just—you were so beautiful and so <i>NAKED</i>; I couldn’t help myself. Aw, shit. I feel like such a scumbag…” </p><p>Now, it was Applejack’s turn to blush. She began playing the hairpin again.“Ya really think I’m beautiful? Well, shucks.”</p><p>“Sure do. Haha. I mean, I did get to see <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">A LOT</span> more of you than most guys would before their first date so...” Haki quietly admitted while rubbing his hands together. </p><p>Applejack reached over and hesitantly placed her hand atop Haki’s. “Ah don’t think yer a creep or a scumbag, Haki. Ah chose to bare mah body. It’d be downright silly ta expect folks not ta look at me in that sort o’ situation. It’s what Ah got paid ta do. So, don’t beat yerself up over it.” </p><p>Haki breathed a sigh of relief. “Good. I’m happy that we can move forward with things instead.” </p><p>“Um… regardin’ that,” Applejack interjected after clearing her throat, “If yer serious about goin' out with me, there’s an important aspect of mah life that ya oughta know about first. See, the thing is: mah family and Ah don’t normally wear clothes around our property. We’re naturists, Haki. Have been fer generations.”   </p><p>Haki’s eyes widened in understanding. “So, that’s why you looked so comfortable modeling. You’re used to people seeing you naked all the time. Makes perfect sense to me.”</p><p>Applejack chuckled. “Well, yes and no. Ah was still nervous as hell, sittin’ in front o’ so many strangers. And—uh—you too, Ah guess. Bein’ nude amongst mah family is totally different. Ah hope that doesn’t turn ya away. Ah just wanted ta make sure ya knew about mah lifestyle first.”</p><p>“I have to admit that it’s a little strange to hear that you and your family are naturists. To be honest, it’ll probably take some getting used to on my part. But! I’d still like to give dating you a try. Umm… so long as you’re ok with it, AJ. Are you still interested?” Haki asked with a hopeful smile. </p><p>Applejack giggled. “Sure am, Haki! Just text me or gimme a call whenever you’d like ta hang out or somethin’. I’m game fer whatever ya have in mind.” </p><p>“Ok, then. Sounds good to me. So… I’ve got to head back to my aunt’s house before it gets too late. You know, stuff to work on and whatnot. I’ll try to call you later when I’m not busy.”</p><p>“Catch ya later, Haki. Lookin’ forward to yer call.” </p><p>Once Haki was well on his way, Applejack allowed herself a girlish giggle of delight. She tapped out a quick text to Rarity in order to let her friend know what happened. Based on Rarity’s near bombastic reply full of emojis, Applejack assumed she was happy to hear the news. Before getting too far ahead of herself, Applejack took a moment to consider how Haki might react when he finally decided to visit Sweet Apple Acres. She hoped that he would take it in stride like Apple Bloom’s friends had, but only time would tell. For the time being, she remained cautiously optimistic. At the very least, she had a boyfriend now. That was worth celebrating.</p>
