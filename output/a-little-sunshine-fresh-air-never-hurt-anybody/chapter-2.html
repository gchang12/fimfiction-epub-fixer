		<h1>Fun At The Family Pond</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 2</b></p><p>Sweet Apple Acres, Ponyville </p><p>All things considered, Apple Bloom thought her friends’ visit was going as well as could be expected, thus far. Despite Applejack’s concern, Scoots and Sweetie were not immediately accusing her of being a pervert, which was a win. That being said their reaction to Big Mac’s… dangly bits made it clear that casual nudity was well outside their comfort zone. </p><p>Apple Bloom quietly lamented that, just for once, she'd like to have some friends who whole-heartedly embraced naturism like her own family had. But sadly, the teenager knew that wasn't going to happen anytime soon. Sweetie and Scoots needed to discover that on their own terms.</p><p>Standing in front of the bathroom door, Bloom automatically reached out to open the door. As she did a pair of twin shrieks came from within. </p><p>“OCCUPIED!” Scootaloo’s voice yelled, cracking at the last moment. </p><p>Sweetie Belle’s voice was no less panicked, “I’m not decent!”</p><p>Snickering, the farm girl replied, “Girls, relax, it’s just me. Not like I haven’t seen y’all before in the locker room. Can I come in?”</p><p>There was some rustling from within as Scootaloo replied, “Fine. Just… so long as your <i>BIG</i> brother--uh—isn’t around.”</p><p>Pushing the door open, AB slipped in and shut it firmly behind her. Even though she'd seen her friends naked plenty of times before, Apple Bloom understood the value of privacy. Turning around she crossed her arms underneath her breasts, leaned back against the door, and took in the scene.</p><p>Scootaloo, blushing from eyes to chest, was currently standing in front of the mirror, checking herself out. True to her word, the bikini was nothing scandalous and instead looked more like a sports bra and short-shorts. The orange garments were accented with gold lightning and covered up enough to preserve her modesty, yet let her toned midriff bare. Bloom privately thought Scoots looked a lot like Rainbow Dash, a local sports super star her friend idolized. </p><p>Meanwhile, Sweetie Belle was still in the process of putting on her much girlier bikini. The pink top she'd already secured over her growing bosom was frilly like a dress. Unfortunately, she was still having trouble fitting the frilly, skirt-like bottom over her hips. Over the past few months, Apple Bloom noticed that her friend had become increasingly self-conscious about the size of her hips and bottom. The current situation wasn't doing anything to increase her confidence.</p><p>“Need a hand Sweetie?”</p><p>“Nu-uh, Bloom, almost got it- there!” Sweetie grunted as she shimmied into the bikini bottom. Slapping her thigh, she laughed. “HA HA! Don’t have to go on a diet yet…”</p><p>“Sweetie, we've been over this. Ya ain't fat. There's no need fer ya ta go on a diet.”</p><p>The other teen waved her hand dismissively. &quot;I know. Rarity and mom are always telling me how the Belle women are blessed with 'fabulous hips' but I don't quite see the appeal. It's... kind of embarrassing 'cause the boys stare at me sometimes when they think I'm not looking.&quot;</p><p>Scootaloo looked down at the floor and shuffled her feet. &quot;Well, at least you look like a girl. I could run around shirtless in the park and everyone'd think I was a boy,&quot; She placed her hands on her chest, &quot;Who am I kidding? I can't pull off this bikini. Listen, I'll just--&quot;</p><p>Sweetie shook her head, “Stop right there, Scoots, you look super cute in that! Very fit and athletic just like Dash.”</p><p>Scootaloo blushed. &quot;Oh! Just like Rainbow Dash? You really think so?&quot;</p><p>Bloom walked over and gave her friend a light squeeze on the arm, “Totally, at least 20 percent cooler ah would say.”</p><p>&quot;Bah! Ya whipper snappers ain't got nothin' ta worry 'bout. Plenty o' time left fer y'all ta fill out more.&quot;</p><p>The three friends jumped slightly as they turned to find Granny Smith sticking her head through the door. The Apple Matriarch’s care lined face was crinkled in a smile as she winked at them, “Just be thankful y’all ain’t had to deal with her bits drooping yet.”</p><p>Apple Bloom rolled her eyes. &quot;Granny, yer the last person ta be talkin' 'about things droopin'!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Comes with gettin' old, child. I'll have ya know that I'm in great shape fer a golden gal!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uhh... hi, Mrs. Smith,&quot; Scootlaoo muttered awkwardly, &quot;How's it hanging?&quot;</p><p>“Scootaloo! That’s rude!” Sweetie hissed elbowing her friend in the side.</p><p>Granny laughed. &quot;Ah just wanted ta let y'all know that I'll be sunnin' mahself out back iffin ya need me. Ah think yer sister'll be joinin' ya fer a dip later on. Oh, and be a dear and take Winnona with ya. That pooch's been bouncin' off the walls all mornin'...&quot;</p><p>“Sure thing Granny.”</p><p>&quot;Much obliged. Y'all have fun now and feel free ta do a bit o' skinny-dippin' if ya feel so inclined. Yer only young once!&quot; Cackling, the elder Apple left the trio of teenagers to their own devices.</p><p>&quot;Everyone ready,&quot; Sweetie and Scootaloo nodded, &quot;Alright then. Let's head on over ta the family pond!&quot;</p><hr/><p>Blades of cool grass tickled Applejack's feet while she strode towards the family pond. The sensation put her at ease somehow but not in a way that she could easily articulate into words. That, combined with the cool breeze gently caressing her skin and the warmth of the sun radiating all around her, put the young farmer in a contemplative state as she approached the swimming hole.</p><p>Applejack smiled while she breathed in the scent of apple blossoms. This time of year, the entire orchard was in full bloom. It hinted at the eventual harvest that would come in the fall. Of course, fall was a relative term around Ponyville. The weather tended to be fairly mild all year around. It's what made the farm so viable over the years and allowed the Apple Family to enjoy their naturist lifestyle regardless of the season. Applejack closed her eyes and thought back to those golden days when she was younger. No schoolwork. No chores around the farm. She spent her time running, climbing, swimming, and just about whatever she pleased.</p><p>Upon turning around the bend, the blonde-haired farmer let out a heavy sigh. When her parents died, everything changed. With the farm down two vital hands, Applejack had thrown herself into keeping everything in order and had little time for daydreaming or the drama at school. In fact, considering how her onetime best friend, Golden Harvest, had reacted upon learning of her family's lifestyle, Applejack relished focusing her undivided attention into the endless chores that needed done and helping to raise her baby sister.</p><p>&quot;Ah never did get around ta makin' proper friends after that.&quot; Applejack lamented. While it was true that the teenager wanted to avoid being hurt again, always having farm work to do gave her the perfect excuse to avoid anything that resembled a social life. Unhealthy though it may have been in hindsight, she'd preferred it that way.</p><p>Applejack paused to study the familiar waterway as she reached the top of the hill. Stream fed, the pond was about the size of three swimming pools combined, with the far bank covered in cattails. The pond was not a true beach, unlike a lake or an ocean. However, Applejack's father had dumped what remained of the white sand he'd used to build the wine cellar around the shore to create an artificial one several years prior. Bright Mac had wanted to give his children a nice place to swim and play around in, always the thoughtful father. </p><p>Applejack's breasts bounced ever so slightly while she jogged down the hill. When she reached the shore, she crouched down in the sand, scooped up a handful, and let it slip through her fingers. If she were a bit more poetic, she might have come up with some witty remark about time being finite. In a sense, she was as young as Granny said... but the blonde farmer knew that the longer she waited to spread her wings, the harder it would be to fly.</p><p>Tossing the last of it away she muttered, &quot;Damn it. Ah hate it when those two have a point.&quot;</p><p>A familiar yipping bark and the scrabble of paws in the grass interrupted her reverie. Half turning, Applejack let out a shout of surprise as a furry brown dynamo slammed into her chest, sending the young farmer tumbling onto her ass in the sand. Applejack growled in mock anger while Winona's tongue began lapping at her face and neck.</p><p>&quot;Lands sakes, Winnona! Where the hell did ya come from, huh?&quot; Applejack managed with one eye closed as she stared up at her furry tormentor.</p><p>The white and brown furred border collie was middle-aged by dog standards at seven years old and retained the youthful energy of her puppy days. She'd been purchased by Granny Smith for the express purpose of cheering up Big Mac and AJ after their parents' passing. The dog's neatly trimmed paws tickled Applejack's exposed stomach inadvertently, causing her to giggle at the sensation. Grabbing the dog by her side, AJ lifted Winona, nuzzled her wet snout, and placed the dog next to her in the grass. She happily licked her mistress's face.</p><p>Apple Bloom's voice echoed from atop the hill. &quot;Dang it, Winona! Ah told ya ta stay put!&quot; The redheaded teen's voice held little malice but did cause the collie's fluffy, brown tail to stop wagging.</p><p>&quot;No harm done, Bloom. She's just excited ta see me,&quot; Applejack assured as she leant over and scratched behind the dog's ear. &quot;Who's a good gal, huh?&quot; Winona resumed wagging her tail immediately, confirming that she did, in fact, consider herself to be a good girl.</p><p>&quot;Wow, AB! Why didn't ya tell us about this place before?&quot; Scootaloo asked when she joined her friend on the top of the hill. &quot;This is totally awesome! You've even got some sand to make it look like a real beach!&quot;</p><p>Sweetie Belle pouted. &quot;I told Rarity that bringing along a plastic shovel and bucket wasn't a stupid idea...&quot;</p><p>As the three teenagers descended the hill, Applejack rose to her feet after petting Winona's head. Stretching out her arms, she shot them a stern glare. &quot;Listen up, y'all. Ah assume ya can swim but if ya don't, speak up now or look like a drownin' fool.&quot; When they shook their heads, she smiled. &quot;Good. Otherwise, don't roughhouse too much and enjoy the family pond.&quot;</p><p>Apple Bloom rolled her eyes and placed her hands on her hips. &quot;C'mon, Applejack! We ain't a bunch o' babies!&quot;</p><p>Applejack gave her little sister a playful noogie. &quot;Ah know but I'm just lookin' out for ya. It's mah job, after all.&quot;</p><p>While the trio chatted amongst themselves and laid out their towels, Applejack hung her trademark Stetson on a nearby tree branch. Undoing her red srunchie, she shook her long, blonde hair loose before breaking into a run towards the water's edge. When she splashed into the shallows, she planted her feet firmly into the sand, muscled thighs tensing. Then she launched herself into a graceful dive to the bottom of the pond.</p><p>Applejack felt a sense of calm envelop her while she swam. As she glided just underneath the surface of the water, she opened her eyes and watched sand give way to silt, then little algae-coated pebbles. A few fish darted away from her into the shadows, which caused Applejack to snort with laughter, sending a few bubbles rising to the surface.</p><p>While the crystal clear waters washed away all the sweat and grime, Applejack heard the sound of another body hitting the water. Turning around so she floated in the middle of the pond, she watched Sweetie Belle attempting to wade through the shallows. Moments later, the poor girl was shoved into the water by Scootaloo, who grinned widely at the spectacle of her friend flailing about. The two wrestled for a moment before rising to the surface once more.</p><p>Applejack followed them and broke the surface with a slight gasp. After wiping her face, she watched as Apple Bloom did a cannonball between her two friends, drenching them further. Laughing and shouting, the trio began a splash war, which put a smile on Applejack's face and warmed her heart. Winona, for her part, ran to the water's edge and started leaping in the shadows barking at all of them. </p><p>Wading over to join them, Applejack splashed her little sister playfully. As the red head shrieked in surprise, Applejack moved in and grabbed Apple Bloom around the waist and casually hoisted her into the air. The elder sister grunted and tossed the younger into the pond with a resounding splash.</p><p>Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo gawked at their thoroughly soaked friend in awe as she cracked her neck and grinned like a wolf. &quot;Alright! Who's next?&quot;</p><p>The next half-hour was filled with shrieking, splashing, and general shenanigans as the trio of teenagers frolicked with youthful energy in abundance. The more Applejack saw her little sister having fun with them, the more she began to lament on her own lack of friends. If Apple Bloom could have this much fun with other people her own age, why couldn't she?</p><p>The blonde haired farmer let out a wistful sigh as she laid back on her towel, letting the sun dry her skin. Beside her Winona was curled up in a ball and snoring after a good deal of swimming and splashing of her own. Sweetie and Scootaloo had likewise retreated to the beach for some sunbathing. That left Apple Bloom floating on her back in the middle of the pond, watching the clouds drift by overhead. Applejack slipped on a pair of her favorite aviators and was content to watch everyone have fun. The two teens lounging across from her seemed to think that they were doing a good job of hiding their curiosity, but Applejack knew better. They were staring.</p><p>Eventually, when Applejack saw Sweetie Belle cupping her breasts and jerking her head in the general direction of where she was laying, the farmer sighed. Sitting up straight, Applejack pulled down her shades, raised her brow, and gave them a stern look. &quot;Y'all are actin' like ya ain't never seen a pair o' boobs on a grown woman before. What's goin' on? And don't lie ta me. Ah can tell.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Staring? HA! No, we TOTALLY weren't staring at your boobs, Applejack. Just... admiring all your freckles?&quot; Sweetie squeaked.</p><p>Applejack shook her head. &quot;So, ya were checkin' me out then. Ah see how it is.&quot;</p><p>Scootaloo waved her hand. &quot;Pssht. What? Us? Checking you out? Contrary to what all the boys in our grade think, I'm not a lesbian!&quot; When Applejack raised her brow even higher, Scootaloo sighed in defeat. &quot;Ok, we... kind of were checking you out, Applejack. Sorry, it's just--&quot;</p><p>&quot;We're super jealous of that amazing bod of yours!&quot; Sweetie blurted out.</p><p>Scootaloo bonked her friend on the head. &quot;Ugh. Real smooth, Sweetie. But she's right. You don't look anything like those chicks online and... w-well you're just so confident about your body and being nude, in general. You and Apple Bloom.&quot; She added as Apple Bloom emerged from the water.</p><p>After adjusting one of the straps of her top, Sweetie sighed. &quot;Sorry, Applejack. We didn't mean to gawk at you.&quot;</p><p>Water dripping from her body onto the grass, Apple Bloom stood in front of her friends and put her hands on her hips. &quot;We've been over this. There's nothin' wrong with the way ya look. Ya hear me? It ain't healthy ta always compare yerselves ta everyone else.&quot;</p><p>Applejack held up her hand. &quot;Hold on, 'Bloom. Girls, confidence doesn't happen overnight. Just 'cause mah sister and Ah have no trouble walkin' 'round in our birthday suits doesn't mean we don't git a little shy from time ta time.&quot; Applejack chuckled and scratched her head. &quot;Hell, I've got more muscle on me than some fellers out there. Ain't exactly the picture of feminine grace n' charm either.&quot;</p><p>Apple Bloom snorted. &quot;C'mon, sis! Yer just as bad as they are! Men like all kinds o' women. Same applies the other way around. If everyone looked the same, life would be a big ole boring mess. Mah point is: yer body goin' through changes can be a might scary, gross, and weird at times. But it's the only one you've got. Learn ta love it, Ah say. That's the trick when it comes ta confidence.&quot;</p><p>Applejack blushed and chuckled bashfully. &quot;Eeyep. That's the long n' short of it. Imagine that. Mah little sister givin' a better puberty talk than I could.&quot;</p><p>Apple Bloom blushed in kind and shuffled her feet in the grass. &quot;Aw shucks. It ain't nothin' special. Ah was just teachin' 'em what y'all taught me is all. Couldn't ask fer better role models.&quot;</p><p>Rising to her feet, Applejack embraced her younger sister which she returned happily. Nuzzling the top of Apple Bloom's head, Applejack muttered, &quot;Ma n' Pa would be proud o' the woman you've become, 'Bloom. Ah know Ah am.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Awww, that's so sweet!&quot; Sweetie cooed.</p><p>While their bone-crushing hug continued, Apple Bloom whispered, &quot;They'd be proud of ya too.&quot;</p><p>Blinking away tears that'd somehow managed to show up on the outside, Applejack released her little sister with a proud smile. &quot;Reckon they would. It's a damn shame ya never go ta know 'em like Mac and Ah did. EHEM! We--umm--let's git back ta havin' fun, shall we?&quot;</p><p>Apple Bloom looked down at her feet and played with a strand of her bow. &quot;Sorry, AJ. Ah didn't mean ta git ya all worked up over Ma and Pa. Ah know dealin' with mushy stuff ain't yer strong suit.&quot; </p><p>Applejack leaned forward and kissed Apple Bloom's forehead. &quot;Don't ya worry 'bout it none. Just me bein' sentimental is all.&quot;</p><hr/><p>&quot;Howdy,&quot; Big Mac's familiar baritone echoed from atop the hill. Applejack did her best to hold back a snicker as Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle both gawked at him, cheeks burning red. The teenagers tried their best to act casual, but it was obvious that they were flustered. Mac walked down the hill with a slight smile of his own while carrying two instrument cases and a bottle of apple cider. &quot;Figured y'all could use some refreshments. It's hot out today.&quot;</p><p>Applejack padded over to her brother and took the bottle from his hands. &quot;Eeyup. Say... this ain't the hard stuff, is it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eenope. What'd ya take me fer, AJ? Servin' a bunch o' minors alcohol. It'd be mighty irresponsible o' me.&quot;</p><p>Applejack shrugged. &quot;Ya can never be too careful. Granny's secret brew looks pretty similar. Ah seem ta recall back when we were kids, ya got yerself drunk as a skunk on a bottle, mistakin' it fer the regular stuff. Consider yerself lucky that Ah didn't bother ta take any pictures on the day in question. Ah reckon quite a few of the townsfolk would get a good chuckle outta 'em.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Point taken. Ah made a real ass o' mahself.&quot; Mac mumbled. </p><p>Applejack patted her brother's shoulder. &quot;I'm just teasin' ya, Mac. Go on and git the girls their cider.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Gee, t-thanks BIG Mac,&quot; Sweetie stammered while accepting a cup of cider. Her eyes darted down towards his hairy, muscled chest and back up to his face again. &quot;Ehehe. I was really THIRSTY for  some Apple Brother--erm--I mean APPLE CIDER! Yes, that's totally what I meant to say.&quot;</p><p>After he placed the instrument cases on the ground, Applejack noted that one contained Mac's six-string steel guitar and the other her trusty banjo, the big man knelt down on one knee and ruffled Sweetie's hair. &quot;Yer quite welcome, little lady. Any friend of Apple Bloom's is a friend o' mine.&quot;</p><p>Scootaloo awkwardly accepted her cup of cider with an uneasy smile. &quot;I think you've gone and ruined our expectations for junior high boys...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah wouldn't worry too much 'bout 'em, Scootaloo,&quot; Mac assured, &quot;Boys at that age seldom have anythin' interestin' ta talk 'bout anyway.&quot;</p><p>Applejack clutched her stomach and laughed. &quot;Hey, Mac! Yer one ta talk. Bein' a motormouth lil' snot at that age. Shoot, Ah remember one time when ya were head over heels fer that Cheerliee gal--&quot;</p><p>Big Mac's entire body flushed pink and his voice rose an octave. &quot;Hold on, Applejack. There ain't no need for ya ta dredge up that past like that. How about we all just forget 'bout that and enjoy some nice, refreshin' apple cider, huh?&quot;</p><p>The blonde farmer laughed a bit more, but complied with her brother's request. Together, they served the girls their cider and enjoyed a little for themselves as well. While Scootaloo and Sweetie were still stealing a few glances at Big Mac, he engaged them in some casual conversation about their plans for the summer. As time passed, the awkwardness between them faded, and eventually, they forgot he was nude in the first place. Applejack smiled when the girls became more animated. Her brother had always had a talent for knowing just when to talk and stay silent.</p><p>&quot;Mind explainin' just what the heck LARPin' is?&quot; Mac carefully inquired. </p><p>&quot;Only the most fun you can have with pants on!&quot; Sweetie squeaked enthusiastically. &quot;Me and a couple of guys from school are going to meet up at the park later on. I get to be the kickass warrior princess rescuing my damoiseau in distress from the clutches of an evil queen!&quot; The teenager stuck a heroic pose with her fist raised towards the sky.</p><p>&quot;Gosh, Sweetie! You're such a dork! LARPing is so nerdy.&quot; Scootaloo said while snorting with laughter.</p><p>Sweetie Belle stomped her feet. &quot;No, it's not! Well, ok... maybe a little. But it's still fun! That's all that matters.&quot;</p><p>Mac rubbed his chin in thought. &quot;Hmm. Reminds me o' an Ogres n' Oubliettes campaign. Dang. Back in high school, me and the fellas used ta play campaigns durin' lunch. Had me one mean paladin. Name was Sir Crimson Shield. Eeyup. Good times.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wait... YOU play OnO?!!&quot; Sweetie shouted excitedly. &quot;But you're so... erm---well, not the type.&quot;</p><p>Big Mac shook his head. &quot;Now, girls. It ain't proper ta judge folks based solely on their appearance. Just because Ah was blessed with good genes and worked hard ta git these here muscles, doesn't mean Ah can't enjoy OnO too.”</p><p>&quot;I suppose that's true,&quot; Scootaloo reluctantly admitted, &quot;Sorry for staring at you, Big Mac. Man, I feel like I'm apologizing for a lot of things today.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No need ta fress over it. Everyone makes mistakes. Now, did Ah hear ya wanted ta join a sports team this summer?&quot;</p><p>While Scootaloo relayed her plans to join the soccer team Rainbow Dash was coaching, Applejack slid next to her sister and gave her a gentle nudge. &quot;I'd say that today's been a success, all things considered. Sorry that Ah doubted ya, 'Bloom.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's alright. Y'all were just lookin' out fer me,&quot; Apple Bloom whispered while she rested her head against Applejack's breast. &quot;Besides, Ah hardly knew how any o' this was gonna turn out mahself. But I'm glad that Sweetie n' Scoots know about our way o' life and whatnot.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mhmm. They're a fun bunch. We should have 'em over more often, Ah reckon,&quot; Applejack mused. &quot;In fact, Ah think it's high time we all got more involved with the community. Erm--more so than just supplyin' goods.&quot;</p><p>Apple Bloom raised her brow. &quot;Really? So, does that mean Ah can invite some boys over anytime Ah want?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Guess Ah ought ta make a trip over ta the pharmacy 'n grab some condoms. Can't expect a bunch o' teenagers ta think straight when it comes ta protection and the like.&quot; Applejack muttered.</p><p>Apple Bloom's face matched her bow. &quot;Applejack! Ah ain't talkin' 'bout sex! Just... invitin' some more friends over ta hang out with. Sheesh!&quot;</p><p>Applejack snorted. &quot;Sticks n' stones, sister. Ah know how frisky teenagers can git. Best ta be responsible n' prepared.&quot;</p><p>After finishing her cider, Apple Bloom hugged her sister briefly and got up. &quot;Fair enough. Girls! What say we have ourselves a little contest ta see who can hold their breath the longest underwater? Winner gits some o' Granny's caramel apple pie.&quot;</p><p>Scootaloo's lips spread into a cocky grin while she jammed her thumb towards her chest. &quot;Obviously, it's me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, yeah? Prove it then. Race ya there!&quot;</p><p>Sweetie Belle finished her cider and in a sedate manner, rose to her feet. After brushing herself off, she gave the remaining Apple siblings a polite curtsy. &quot;I should probably make sure those two don't accidentally drown. Thanks for the cider!&quot; </p><p>&quot;Hold on, Sweetie,&quot; Applejack urged, &quot;Is yer sister still in town this summer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yep! Rarity's working at the spa to help pay for college,&quot; Sweetie replied. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;</p><p>Applejack coughed and rubbed the back of her neck. &quot;Erm--well, would ya mind askin' her if she'd be interested in meetin' up with me at a cafe? Just thought I'd try n' catch up with her while Ah still have the chance. I'd appreciate it if ya let her know.&quot;</p><p>Sweetie Belle gave Applejack a thumbs up. &quot;Sure thing! I'll pass along your message.&quot; A loud gasp from the pond followed by arguing caused the curly-haired teen to sigh. &quot;Well, there's my cue. See ya later, Applejack.</p><p>Applejack turned around to see Mac flashing her an amused grin. &quot;What the hell are ya lookin' so smug fer, huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah dunno. Maybe I'm just enjoyin' the fine weather today.&quot;</p><p>Applejack put her hands on her hips and huffed. &quot;Ah call horseshit! Fine. I'll just go on 'n say it. Ya were right. Ah need ta git out more. Happy?&quot;</p><p>“Eyup.” He replied as he unzipped his guitar case and removed his instrument. </p><p>Shaking her head, Applejack followed suit. &quot;Well then, Ah think ya ought ta git out more too, ya big lug.&quot;</p><p>Mac strummed a few test chords and tuned his guitar. &quot;Ah reckon that's fair. What brought this change o' heart on?&quot;</p><p>Applejack shrugged noncommittally. &quot;Just felt like Ah needed a change in mah life, Ah guess.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sounds 'bout right. Wish ya the best, sister.&quot; Mac replied as he began to play the opening bars of Country Roads.</p><p>The two siblings continued to play their respective instruments while the sounds of laughing teenagers filled the air. Change was on the horizon, and even though each of them approached the task differently and at their own pace, the Apples were content to meet it head on. Some distance away on the porch, rocking back and forth in her favorite chair, Granny Smith observed her family with a warm smile and a glass full of whiskey. </p><p>&quot;See that Pear 'n Bright? Yer kids grew up just fine, regardless o' what happened. And I'm damned proud of 'em.&quot;</p>
