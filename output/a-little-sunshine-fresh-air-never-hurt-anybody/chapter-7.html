		<h1>The Russian Connection</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 7</b></p><p>CUAC Building, Canterlot University </p><p>Much to her surprise, Applejack found out that she was quite popular amongst the burgeoning artists of Canterlot University. Everyone she’d spoken with after her nude modeling sessions, praised her for looking healthy, natural, and the confidence she exuded when she posed in front of the class. The blonde farmer took such comments in stride, owing the praise more to her naturist upbringing rather than an innate sense of self-confidence. Well, maybe just a little. Applejack had always gone to great lengths to take care of her body (<i>since it was the only one she would ever get</i>) and was pleased to see that other folks recognized her efforts. </p><p>One student, however, had been conspicuously absent since her first session. Applejack occasionally chatted with Haki every now and again, but for someone who was supposed to be her boyfriend, he seemed somewhat aloof. Even though they’d only been dating for a little over a week and were still trying to figure out the dynamic of their newfound relationship, it made Applejack worry that she’d done or said something to turn him away. After letting out a frustrated sigh, she said goodbye to the exiting students and padded over to the changing room in order to put her clothes back on before heading back to Sweet Apple Acres.  </p><p>Applejack yelped aloud when she nearly ran into a young woman who was standing near the entrance of the changing room while she was closing the door behind her. “Lands sake! Ya nearly gave me a damned heart attack.”</p><p>“My apologies,” the pale-skinned woman replied in a soft Slavic accent, “I didn't mean to frighten you, Miss Applejack.”</p><p>Applejack accepted her apology and shook the woman’s hand. Upon closer inspection, she appeared to be decked out in all dark colors. A tight, black t-shirt with a pink skull printed on the front barely contained her ample bosom. She wore a pleated black skirt with leggings underneath that left little to the imagination as to how curvaceous the rest of her body was. </p><p>Stylish combat boots and various piercings completed her ensemble (<i>ears, nose, and eyebrows</i>). Even her lipstick, eyeshadow, and silky, shoulder-length hair were black as coal. Save for a single, teal streak that ran down the center. Applejack supposed that for some folks, being part of the goth subculture wasn’t just a phase that they went through during their teenage years. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” Applejack reassured, “Oh, and um—ya can just call me AJ if ya want. Miss makes me sound old. What can Ah do fer ya?” </p><p>“AJ it is then! I suppose I should introduce myself as well. My name is Natalia Rozmonov. But everyone around here just calls me Roz. As for my purpose, I wanted to let you know just how much I admire your work here as a model. Quite the inspiration, if I do say so myself.” </p><p>Applejack blushed and rubbed the back of her neck. “Thanks, Roz. Appreciate the kind words. Although, Ah ain’t sure that Ah deserve such high praise fer just sittin’ around in mah birthday suit fer a spell. Ta be honest, it’s not too much different from what Ah do when Ah git home.”</p><p>Roz rubbed her chin in thought. “Is that so? Are you, perhaps, a naturist? I can tell that you are very comfortable in your own skin. Such a thing does not come easily to most people. Please forgive my forwardness for assuming. I am simply curious.” </p><p>Applejack rubbed her arm. “Well, Ah reckon there ain’t much point in denyin’ it. Yer right, Roz. Ah am a naturist. Born ‘n raised. Mah family are too. Ah live with ‘em over at Sweet Apple Acres. Maybe you’ve heard of our farm?” </p><p>The goth nodded enthusiastically. “How wonderful! I cannot tell you how hard it is to find fellow naturists around these parts. I’m glad that my instincts about you were correct!” </p><p>“Uh… beg yer pardon?” </p><p>Roz blushed slightly. “Oh! I suppose I should explain. You see, my family came to live here from overseas. Back in the Motherland, my people did not treat nudity with the same taboos as people do here. Like when it comes to swimming, hiking, or bathing in a sauna. Although, my family took it a step beyond that. We never wore clothing around the house if we could help it.” </p><p>Applejack chuckled. “Sounds a lot like mah own childhood.”</p><p>Roz hugged Applejack without a shred of hesitation, which threw the farmer completely off guard. Applejack blushed when she felt the edge of Roz's nipple piercings rub up against her chest (<i>Roz wore no bra, despite having such large breasts</i>). “We are kindred spirits, you and I! I can already tell that we shall become the best of friends. If you’ll have me, that is.”</p><p>Applejack returned the embrace as best she could, given the awkward circumstances. “Ah could always use more friends. Especially ones who don’t mind if I’m nekkid around ‘em. So—um—Ah couldn’t help but notice that you’ve got quite a few piercings. Are they—”</p><p>“Everywhere? Yes! I bought the most adorable clit stud the other day. It has an amethyst in the center. Sterling silver. That is the best part about piercings when you are nude. Everyone can see just how cute they are! What about you, Applejack? Do you have any that I should know about?”</p><p>Applejack cringed at the thought of sticking any amount of metal through her private parts. “No, I’m afraid not. Never got mah ears pierced either. It’s a bit o’ a safety concern when yer workin’ on the farm. Jewelry tends ta get caught on equipment. Can’t have that. <b>EENOPE</b>!” </p><p>Roz patted her shoulder. “Mhmm. You look… better without them, I think. Yes, the all-natural look suits you quite well. Many of my fellow artists would agree that it is part of your—shall we say—country girl charm. Your freckles are adorable too! Given my own pale complexion, I don’t tan well, so I must apply plenty of sunscreen before I venture outside.”</p><p>“Oh. Well, that must be a hassle. Ah never had ta worry about sunburn too much mahself. Still take plenty ‘o precautions though. Ya can never be too careful about that sort o’ thing.” </p><p>Roz offered Applejack her phone. “We can exchange numbers!” </p><p>“Sure thing, Roz. So—uh—I’ve been thinkin’. Since it’s gettin’ close ta supper time anyway, how’d ya like ta tag along with me back ta Sweet Apple Acres? Ah promise there’ll be plenty o’ food ta go around. I’m sure everyone won’t mind if Ah bring a guest. What do ya say?” </p><p>Roz jumped up and down excitedly, causing her breasts to jiggle. “I would love to, AJ! Thank you so much for the invitation! It’s been ages since I had a hearty, home cooked meal. Hehe. I’m not a very good cook to be honest. Am I to assume that the dress code will be causal?” </p><p>Applejack rolled her eyes. “There ain’t one, ya goober.” </p><p>“That was a joke. It is funny because we are naturists and—” Roz began to explain. </p><p>Applejack groaned. “Yeah, Ah know. Just wasn’t a very good one.”</p><p>Roz’s cheeks flushed rosy pink while she bit her lip. “Forget I said anything…” </p><p>“No, I’m sorry, Roz. Ah didn’t mean ta put ya down. Mah old gal-pal Rainbow Dash used ta tell stupid jokes like that all the time back when we were in high school. Afraid it was a knee-jerk reaction on mah part. Damn it. Now, Ah feel like the biggest asshole ever.” </p><p>Roz twirled a strand of her raven hair, choosing to ignore Applejack’s obvious discomfort. “At least I won’t have to worry about what to wear in front of your family. You have to understand that many people whom I’ve met in the past tend to dislike my style of dress. When the need arises, that is. So… what shall be on the menu, if you don’t mind my asking?”</p><p>“Ah imagine ‘Bloom will be in charge o’ the cookin’ today. Hmm. Fried chicken, mashed taters with cheese sauces, ‘n green beans. Apple family classic cuisine. Sound good? Hey—um—ya ain’t one o’ them vegans are ya? If ya are, I’m afraid mah pantry ain’t properly stocked fer that.” </p><p>Roz giggle snorted. “There’s no need to worry about my dietary preferences, Applejack. I love all kinds of food! Meat, fruit, veggies, and especially deserts! But I’m sure you could already tell that I enjoy eating because of my dainty figure, no?” </p><p>Applejack laughed. “Ain’t nothin’ wrong with havin’ a healthy appetite.” </p><p>The two naturists chatted amicably on their way to the parking lot. From what Applejack could gather, Roz was majoring in fine cuisine and had aspirations to become a <i>patisserie</i>. It certainly explained why she loved deserts so much and why she had a bit more meat on her bones than the average girl. She reminded Applejack of Pinkie Pie, but not quite so… unbearably hyperactive. Pinkie’s heart was usually in the right place most of the time. Unfortunately, she tended to be difficult to put up with at times due to her short attention span and lack of personal boundaries. </p><p>“How long’s it been since Ah last spoke ta Pinkie? Can’t even remember…” Applejack muttered to herself while she drove down the road. </p><p>“Pardon me, but did you say something?” Roz asked. </p><p>“Nah. Ah was just thinkin’ out loud. A habit o’ mine on occasion.” </p><p>Roz looked out the window at the passing trees. “Who is Pinkie Pie, if I may ask?” </p><p>“One o’ mah girlfriends from high school. She was the outgoin’, bubbly, energetic type. Loved ta make sweets n’ eat ‘em too. Ah suppose ya could say that she was pleasantly plump. Heh. All o’ that talk about pie n’ whatnot got me thinkin’ about her. Ah wonder what she’s up to.”  </p><p>Roz shrugged. “It sounds to me as though you should reconnect with her.” </p><p>Applejack gripped the steering wheel and frowned. “Maybe Ah should.”</p><p>“What’s stopping you?” </p><p>The blonde farmer sighed. “A lot o’ silly reasons. Stuff that shouldn’t even matter anymore, but I’ve been tryin’ ta come outta mah shell since the end o’ high school. Be more social with folks.” </p><p>“Curious. I hadn’t pegged you as an introvert.”</p><p>Applejack made a turn onto the dirt road that led to Sweet Apple Acres. “Only because you’ve known me fer such a short time not ta know otherwise. Let’s just say that Ah had a hard time durin’ mah grade school days with the whole bein’ a naturist bit. It was somethin’ the other kids would’ve misunderstood or made fun o’ me fer. That’s why Ah clammed up n’ shut ‘em out.” </p><p>Roz reached over and rubbed her new friend’s shoulder encouragingly. “Oh, Applejack. I’m very sorry to hear that you had a difficult childhood.”</p><p>“Mah childhood had it’s ups n’ downs. That’s fer sure. Point is: Ah can’t change what happened, but Ah can take mah life in a new direction now. Well—uh—we’re almost at the house. Feel free ta take off yer clothes as soon as Ah park the truck. We own all o’ the property ya see out there.” </p><hr/><p>Haki let out a tired sigh as he opened the front door to his aunt’s cabin. It had been a long day full of classwork and he’d decided to stay at the library for a while to get all of his assignments done instead of coming back home right away. He dropped off his backpack in his room, went back into the kitchen, and started brewing a cup of coffee. He made just enough for his aunt, as it was her habit to indulge in a late-afternoon pick me up around three o’clock. As if on cue, she padded into the kitchen, wearing only a smile, and poured herself a cup. Haki took a seat next to her at the table, shortly thereafter and stirred some creamer into his mug. </p><p>Zecora closed her eyes for a moment and took in a deep breath. “How were your classes today, nephew?” </p><p>“Not too bad, I guess. Got a lot of assignments though.” </p><p>Zecora nodded. “It was wise of you to complete them in the library. Trying to get work done at home can be… difficult, I find. Too many things to distract me. Besides, home is a place where you should go to relax, not write a twenty-page lab report.” </p><p>“For sure. Hey—um—Aunt Z, can I get your advice on something?” Haki asked hesitantly. </p><p>Zecora raised her brow while she sipped on her coffee. “Oh? What brought this on?” </p><p>“Well, there’s this girl I met on campus. We bumped into each other earlier, during the summer when my car broke down. She fixed it and I treated her to some ice cream. Follow so far?” </p><p>“Mhmm. Go on, Hakizimana. I am listening.” Zecora encouraged. </p><p>Haki stared into his half-empty coffee cup and blushed. “Long story short, we started talking, exchanged numbers, and I wound up seeing her at the art club. I-I mean… like <b>REALLY</b> saw her, you know. It turns out that she volunteered to be a nude model.”</p><p>“There is nothing wrong with that, as you know.” </p><p>Haki shook his head. “Of course, not. I wasn’t implying otherwise, Aunt Z. It’s what I found out about her afterwards that threw me for a loop.”</p><p>“It seems to me that you are interested in this young lady far beyond what one would consider as a casual acquaintance. Do you, perhaps, wish to go out on a date with her?” </p><p>Haki rubbed the back of his neck and chuckled. “Heh. Uh… that’s just it. We already agreed that we liked each other and started going out. But we’ve—I’ve—run into a bit of a roadblock. It turns out that the reason she was so cool about nude modeling was because she’s a naturist.” </p><p>Zecora laughed. “Ah~ So the truth is revealed!”</p><p>“Look, you’ve got experience with this sort of thing. I don’t. I want to approach her lifestyle with an open mind and not be too judgmental about how weird it is to do <i>EVERYTHING</i> naked all the time. What should I do, Aunt Z? I can’t very well lie to her and say that I’m comfortable with it.” </p><p>Zecora leaned back in her chair and hummed. “There is but one thing you can do, Hakizimana.” </p><p>“Oh, yeah? What’s that?” </p><p>Zecora finished her coffee, walked over to the window, and gestured outside. “Why, take off your clothes and experience the lifestyle for yourself! I am not suggesting that you do anything more drastic than try it here at the cabin where we are afforded a great deal of privacy.” </p><p>Haki felt his stomach twist into a nervous knot. “I’m not sure if I can—”</p><p>Zecora waggled her finger. “Do not be so prudish, nephew. I’ve seen plenty of naked men before, so seeing your body in the same state will not bother me. Go on. Take your clothes off.” </p><p>“It’s not you I’m worried about. Ok, fine! I’ll admit it. The thought of walking around with my junk dangling about is… embarrassing. Especially, if it’s in front of a bunch of other people. Or—erm—my new girlfriend. I know it’s only fair because I’ve already seen her naked—” </p><p>Zecora rolled her eyes. “What people are you referring to? It is just you and me here. Listen, Hakizimana. If your girlfriend is a naturist as you say, then she will not make fun of your body no matter what it looks like or if you feel any particular part of you is inadequate.” </p><p>Sensing that it was pointless to argue with his aunt about semantics, Haki began taking off his shirt. Zecora said nothing when he was finally nude, but took hold of his hand and guided him out to the greenhouse where she liked to garden from time to time. Upon stepping outside, the first thing he noticed was the sensation of the wind tickling his bare skin, and the sun warming his back. Even though the sensation was hardly what he would call unpleasant, it made Haki feel (<i>naked obviously</i>) vulnerable in a way that he could scarcely describe. Zecora stopped for a moment, took in a deep breath, and put her hands on her hips. </p><p>“This is what it is like to enjoy nature as nature intended, nephew. Do not be afraid to let it all hang out, as they say. Haha~ Well, I suppose in your case, that might be a bit more literal.” </p><p>A furious blush colored Haki’s cheeks. He had to resist the urge to cover up his privates. “C’mon, Aunt Z! I didn’t agree to do this just so you could tease me!” </p><p>Zecora opened the door to the greenhouse and sniffed one of the roses. “You have nothing to be ashamed of, Hakizimana. You are a healthy, fit, handsome young man. Take pride in all of the hard work you put into keeping your body conditioned. Think of this as a way to show it off.” </p><p>Haki awkwardly shuffled into the greenhouse and stood beside his aunt. “I guess so…” </p><p>“If you are worried about her scrutinizing the size of your member, you shouldn’t be. Naturists do not judge people on what their bodies look like. Neither should you, for that matter.” </p><p>Haki rubbed his arm. “I never did. That is to say… I thought she was beautiful the very moment I first laid eyes on her. Even more so when I got to see her naked at the art building. Sorry. That made me sound like a creep, didn’t it?” </p><p>Zecora watered a tomato vine. “No, I do not think so. It means that you appreciate her beauty even when everything else like clothing, jewelry, and cosmetics are stripped away. Such an attitude is to be admired in one’s partner, I believe. Hmm. Not once have you mentioned her name, Hakizimana. Why is that? Are you afraid to tell me who your mysterious beau is?”</p><p>“Oh! My bad. I thought I mentioned her name earlier. It’s Applejack. She runs a farm somewhere around here, but I’m not sure where exactly. I’ve never been there before. Apparently, her entire family are also naturists and don’t wear clothing on the property.”  </p><p>Zecora froze in place. “Applejack, you say?” </p><p>“Yeah. What’s the problem, Aunt Z? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” </p><p>Zecora turned around with a sheepish smile. “Well, it just so happens that I am good friends with the Apple Family. I have known them for many years. Including, young Applejack.” </p><p>Haki’s jaw dropped. “<b>WHAT</b>?!!” </p><p>It was Zecora’s turn to blush. She took a moment to clear her throat before replying. “I swear that I was not trying to keep my relationship with the Apple Family a secret from you. It had not occurred to me that you were referring to Applejack until you mentioned her by name. This is wonderful news! She is such a lovely, hard-working, young woman. You could not have chosen a better person to be your partner. I am so happy for you both, Hakizimana!” </p><p>Haki shuffled his feet. “Yeah, she totally is. Umm… do you understand why it’s so important for me to make a good impression with AJ? I want our relationship to work. But that’s not gonna happen if I can’t accept her lifestyle for what it is. I’ve spent the last few days trying to figure everything out. She probably thinks I’m avoiding her.”</p><p>Zecora wrapped her nephew in a gentle hug. “I am certain that you shall find a way to make it work. How about this: I want you to spend the rest of the evening nude. Sleep that way too. The longer you go without clothing, the easier it becomes to forget that you’re not wearing them.”</p><p>“Are you sure? Because it still feels pretty awkward to me…” </p><p>Zecora cupped his cheeks. “Stop thinking about what society has told you. There is nothing wrong with getting back in touch with nature through your body. Take a deep breath, relax, and go about your business. Naturism is about being comfortable with yourself.”  </p><p>“Ok. I’ll try… I guess.” Haki muttered. </p><hr/><p>Roz took Applejack’s advice to heart and immediately began stripping as soon as the truck was parked right next to the farmhouse. The blonde farmer noticed a few interesting things about her new friend while they made their way up the stairs to her room. Roz hadn’t been kidding when she said she had a pale complexion. Despite being a naturist for her entire life, not a single speck of her creamy-white skin was even the least bit tanned or freckled. In fact, one of the first things she did was ask where the bathroom was so that she could apply some sunscreen. </p><p>While Applejack put away her own outfit, she observed that Roz had a much fuller figure than she initially suspected. After all, that’s what clothing was supposed to do. Conceal a person’s physique from wandering eyes. Roz reminded Applejack of the nude models featured in one of those old-timey paintings from the nineteenth century. Where plump, pale-skinned women with wide hips were seen as the most desirable. A sign of healthy child-bearing, if nothing else.  </p><p>Applejack looked at her own reflection in the mirror and sighed. Plenty of people had come right out and said that she was beautiful and held what they referred to as “<i>country girl charm</i>”. It was silly to compare her (<i>farmer’s</i>) physique to that of Roz’s but some tiny, subconscious part of her brain felt jealous over her friend’s ample curves. However, just as quickly as the thought appeared, it was banished from her mind when Roz turned around to say something.  </p><p>“As you can clearly see, I am like a big marshmallow! I burn quite easily.” She remarked. </p><p>Applejack gave her a polite nod. “Reckon ya are. Ah got me an all over tan from workin’ on the farm all day long. The rest o’ mah family are that way too, in case yer wonderin’.” </p><p>Roz let out a wistful sigh. “Of which I am jealous. For once, I would like to enjoy frolicking outdoors without having to bathe in a gallon of sunscreen first. Oh! What lovely skin cream you have in your cabinet, Applejack. It smells like—hmm—I can’t quite put my finger on it.”</p><p>Applejack raised her brow. “Hmm? Oh, well that’s plumeria. Bought it on Rarity’s suggestion.” </p><p>Roz lifted her leg up onto the toilet seat and began lathering her inner thigh with skin cream. “She has excellent taste, I must say. Um—I hope you don’t mind that I’m being thorough. I try my best to take care of my skin since it is so sensitive and dries out easily.”</p><p>“Nah, it’s fine. Take yer time, Roz. Ah don’t have anywhere else ta be right now.” </p><p>Through pursed lips, Applejack took a gander at what lay nestled in-between Roz’s legs. The old axiom “<i>the carpet matches the drapes</i>” immediately came to mind. The absurdly thick, yet immaculately-trimmed inverse triangle was as black as coal with a teal streak running down the center to match the hair atop her head. And sure enough, the aforementioned clitoral stud was on display down there too. It wasn’t something Applejack would ever wear, but it did look nice. </p><p>Applejack rubbed her arm, trying to think of a polite way to phrase her question. When nothing came to mind, she decided that frankness was her best option. “Say, Roz. I’m curious. Do ya, by chance, dye yer lady fuzz? Because—uh—teal ain’t a natural color fer anybody.” </p><p>Roz was in the middle of applying cream underneath her breast when she looked up. “As a matter of fact, I do. You see, my hair is naturally blonde but I like to color it black and teal. I allow my pubic hair to grow in thick, so that I am able to dye it. However, I feel that it is worth the effort. Waxing it all off would be simpler, I suppose, but a bald coochie lacks character.” </p><p>Applejack let out an awkward chuckle. “Ya certainly got character. That’s fer sure…” </p><p>Roz bounced up and down. “Do you like my nipple piercings? They’re silver to match my stud.” </p><p>Applejack shuddered. “They kind o’ look like tiny barbels. Doesn’t it hurt? Wearin’ ‘em, Ah mean.” </p><p>“Hmm. Not really. You get used to them after a while. They only become a problem when you’re wearing a tight-fitting bra or when they get caught on something. Which rarely happens, in my experience. Were you considering getting a pair of your own? I know a good shop if—”</p><p>Applejack waved her hands. “No, thanks. I’m fine just as Ah am. Piercings ain’t mah thing.” </p><p>“You prefer to keep your body as natural as possible. I can respect that.” </p><p>Applejack nodded. “Yeah. But they do look great on ya. Fits yer sense o’ style, Ah reckon.” </p><p>Roz padded over to her friend and wrapped Applejack up in a big hug. “Aww~ Thank you, Applejack. It means a lot to me to hear you say that.”</p><p>“Tarnation, woman! Yer gonna smother me with them big ole cow udders.” </p><p>Roz blushed. “My apologies. I love giving people hugs. Did I overstep my bounds?” </p><p>“Ah don’t mind hugs. Just gimme a little bit o’ a warnin’ next time. Alright?”  </p><p>When Roz finally finished her skin care routine, the pair of friends descended the stairs and headed into the kitchen for some refreshments. Neither her grandmother nor siblings were around, so Applejack assumed they must have been out doing other things. After they finished a glass of cold spiced cider, Applejack sat out on the porch and watched the clouds pass by with her friend. About a minute passed before Roz began kicking her feet back and forth in the air. </p><p>“Ah can tell yer antsy. C’mon then. Let’s head on over ta the stills. Maybe mah brother’s in there. We can chat if he is and maybe figure out where Apple Bloom went. She’s supposed ta be in charge o’ cookin’ supper tonight. Wouldn’t want mah guest ta go hungry. Eenope.” </p><p>The Apple Family distillery was only a short walk away from the farmhouse. In it, Granny and Mac experimented on, and perfected various spirits over the decades. Their most popular beverage was hard cider but whiskey came in a close second. It was aged in seasoned, oak barrels for a bare minimum of two years for each batch. The most expensive of which had been aged for twenty-five years and was considered on-par with any gold label liquor currently on the open market. Suffice to say, the blend was highly coveted by aficionados, and the Apples would only sell it to customers who passed a rigorous series of background checks (<i>mostly financial</i>) and put a reserve down on the quantity of bottles they wanted to purchase. </p><p>As expected, Macintosh was busy inspecting the barrels for any leaks with Winona at his side. She sat patiently while her master went about his work. That was the understanding they had. She would be a good dog, a quiet dog, and later on, he would give her treats and belly rubs. With any luck, when the youngest mistress came back home from school, Winona would get to sample some scraps from her cooking. The border collie licked her chops at the thought of thick, creamy sawmill gravy and fluffy biscuits. Those were the best! Winona’s ears perked up when she caught Applejack’s scent in the air mixed with… someone else. Another female.</p><p>Applejack knelt down and rubbed Winona’s ears. “Howdy, girl. How’s mah pup doin’?” </p><p>Winona barked happily and licked her mistress’s face a few times. </p><p>Macintosh scribbled something on his clipboard and turned around to greet his sister. “How were yer classes today?” </p><p>“Not too bad, all things considered. Just so ya know, Ah invited a friend over fer supper.”</p><p>Roz waved at Mac with a wide grin. “Hello! My name’s Roz. Who might you be?” </p><p>The muscled farmer responded with a polite nod. “Good evenin’, Miss Roz. Mah name’s Macintosh Apple, Applejack’s older brother. Everyone ‘round these parts just call me Big Mac fer short. Pleasure ta meet yer acquaintance.” </p><p>Roz giggled girlishly, nudged Applejack’s arm, and whispered into her ear. “You never told me that your brother was so charming and handsome! I can see exactly why they call him <i>big</i>. You could say that it’s dangling right in front of us. Meeeeeyow~”  </p><p>The signs were subtle but Applejack could tell that her brother found Roz’s figure equally appealing. Being the proper gentleman that he was, Mac was far too polite to compliment Roz’s appearance directly. There was also the matter of Cheerilee to consider. Applejack sighed. “Hold yer horses, Roz. Mah brother has his eyes set on another gal. He’s off limits, ya hear?” </p><p>Roz crossed her arms underneath her breasts and huffed. “Fine. But you must understand how difficult it is to find handsome, eligible bachelors. Who share our lifestyle, I mean.” </p><p>“Believe me. Ah know all too well. I’m tryin’ mah best ta git Haki ta see things mah way but he’s been distant with me as o’ late. Reckon he just needs a little more time ta git used ta the idea o’ me bein’ a naturist. Not sure what else it would be…” Applejack admitted. </p><p>Roz bounced up and down excitedly, causing everything to jiggle. Out of the corner of her eye, Applejack saw Mac’s cheeks flush pink while he tried to focus his attention elsewhere. “Is Haki your boyfriend? Have I ever met him before? What’s he like? <b>TELL ME</b>!!!”</p><p>Thoroughly embarrassed by Roz’s antics, Applejack shot her brother an apologetic smile. “Maybe later. Fer now, I’d like ya ta meet the family dog. Her name’s Winona. C’mere, girl!” </p><p>Sensing an opportunity for more affection, Winona skittered across the floor and looked up at the pale-skinned female. When she didn’t respond immediately, Winona took it upon herself to nuzzle her wet snout against the woman’s leg. That seemed to do the trick because she laughed, knelt down, and started ruffling Winona’s ears. The border collie whuffed and wagged her tail. </p><p>Roz ruffled Winona’s chest fur. “Oh, my goodness; she’s so adorable! And very fluffy too! I’ll bet she’s fun to cuddle with on a cold day.”  </p><p>“Eeyep. Any day fer that matter. Best dog a gal could ever ask fer.” </p><p>Mac cleared his throat. “Just got a text from ‘Bloom. Says she’s gonna be a little late from school. Somethin’ related ta helpin’ out one o’ her friends with a project. Well—um—I’d better git back ta checkin’ the rest o’ the barrels. Nice meetin’ ya, Roz. See ya later.” </p><p>With Winona in tow, the two women went back to the farmhouse and started getting the table ready for supper. Roz insisted that she help, despite Applejack’s protests that it was rude to expect a guest to do so. Winona, meanwhile, decided that it was as good a time as any to play with her favorite chewie toy. Her excited barks heralded the arrival of Apple Bloom, who rushed up the stairs and came back down to the kitchen, completely nude, in record time. Applejack took one look at her baby sister’s shabby appearance and raised her brow. </p><p>“What do ya think yer doin’, young lady?” </p><p>Slightly out of breath, Apple Bloom grinned. “Helpin’ with supper.” </p><p>“Not like that ya ain’t. We got ourselves a guest this evenin’. Now, march yer rear-end back upstairs and wash up. Yer all sweaty and covered in—what the hell? Is that tree sap?” </p><p>Apple Bloom chuckled awkwardly. “Maybe? Ah had ta help Sweetie n’ Scoots with a school project. Fer our biology class. We decided ta make a presentation on photosynthesis n’ whatnot. Like—uh—with trees n’ all the like. That’s why I’m late. Well… mostly, anyway.” </p><p>Applejack sighed. “Fine. Go wash up. And don’t rush it. Make sure ta be thorough scrub everywhere and everythin’. Ah don’t wanna have ta cut tree sap outta yer pretty red hair just because ya were careless. Then, we can make supper together.”</p><p>Roz smiled when she saw Apple Bloom kiss her older sister’s cheek. “She seems lively.” </p><p>“Takes after her grandmother. Speakin’ o’ which, Ah haven’t seen hide nor hair o’ Granny.” </p><p>The Apple Family Matriarch padded into the kitchen, yawned, and scratched her bottom. “Quit yer fussin’. I’m here. Can’t an old woman take a nap in peace?”</p><p>“Sorry, Granny. We didn’t mean ta be loud. It’s just that Apple Bloom came home covered in tree sap n’ Ah didn’t think it was proper fer her ta—”</p><p>Blatantly ignoring her granddaughter’s explanation, Granny gave Roz a once over. “Well, ain’t ya a pretty lil’ thing? Love the piercings ya got there, missy. Bet they come in handy when ya got one o’ them wild dates. Hehe.” </p><p>Roz blinked owlishly. “Oh—um—thank you. What do you mean by handy?” </p><p>Granny scoffed. “Just because I’m old, doesn’t mean Ah don’t know a thing or two when it comes ta whoopie. I’m talkin’ ‘bout when the boys like ta play n’ tease ya with ‘em. Especially the one ya got there on yer bean. Flick it a couple o’ times n’ that’ll make ya more worked up than a jackrabbit durin’—”</p><p>Face flushed with equal parts embarrassment and anger; Applejack put her hands on her hips. “Fer Pete’s sake! That ain’t the kind o’ talk fer the supper table. Shame on ya, Granny.” </p><p>Granny placed her finger on Applejack’s lips. “Hush, child. A curvy minx like her bein’ ignorant o’ such things is like a fish not knowin’ how ta swim. By the way, is she Mac’s new squeeze?” </p><p>“No. Roz is a new friend Ah met at college. She also happens ta be a naturist. Ah thought it’d be a good idea ta invite her over fer supper n’ meet everyone.” </p><p>Granny shook Roz’s hand. “Well, why didn’t ya say so earlier? Welcome ta Sweet Apple Acres, Roz. Just call me Granny. What is it that ya do in college, young lady?” </p><p>“I’m studying to become a <i>patisserie</i>. Applejack and I met for the first time after her most recent modeling session. I can already tell that we shall become the best of friends!”</p><p>Granny poured herself a shot of whisky and slugged it down in one gulp. “Yer still posin’ fer them nudie drawings? Ah thought it made ya uncomfortable. Especially, after what happened with that dark-skinned feller ya fancy. What’s his name? Archie? Ah can’t remember…” </p><p>Applejack rubbed the back of her neck. “His name’s Haki, by the way. And posin’ fer the art club is good money, Granny. Easy too. All Ah gotta do is sit there and change mah pose on occasion. As fer folks takin’ a gander at the goods, it ain’t that different than usual.” </p><p>“It’s yer body, child. Far be it fer me ta lecture ya on who should see it or not. Mah point is: ya best try ta iron things out with yer boyfriend while ya still got the chance. Look, I’ll admit that Ah ain’t the best persona ta ask fer advice when it comes ta matters o’ romance and whatnot. Why doncha ask Zecora? Maybe she could offer ya some o’ that mystical Zebrican wisdom.”</p><p>Applejack shrugged. “Worth a shot, Ah suppose.”</p><p>Roz patted her friend’s shoulder. “I’m always willing to listen, if nothing else.”</p><p>“Thanks, Roz. Appreciate the offer.” </p><p>Apple Bloom came bounding down the stairs once more, except this time, she was as clean as a whistle. Given that she’d just come out of the shower, her hair was still damp and she hadn’t bothered to put on her trademark bow. Instead, it was haphazardly combed straight enough to be presentable. Or, at least, what passed for presentable by a teenager’s definition. The smell of body wash wafted into Applejack’s nose when her little sister gave her a quick hug. </p><p>Apple Bloom rubbed her hands together. “Here’s mah plan fer supper: fried chicken, mashed taters, biscuits, n’ green beans with bacon. Oh, and sawmill gravy, o’ course. Any questions?” </p><p>Roz waved her hands in the air and bounced on her tippy toes. “ME! I HAVE A QUESTION!!!” </p><p>Taken aback by the goth’s enthusiasm, Apple Bloom cleared her throat. “Oh… well—um—Ah don’t think Ah got yer name earlier, miss. Mine’s Apple Bloom. AJ’s little sister, by the way.”  </p><p>“You may call me Roz. My question pertains to desert. What do you have planned for that?” </p><p>Granny cackled with laughter. “Ah reckon she forgot all about it. No matter. Ah got ya covered, Apple Bloom. There’s some caramel apple dumplings in the fridge. That suit yer fancy, Roz?” </p><p>Roz let out an excited squeal. “I’ve never had an authentic country apple dumpling before!” </p><p>“Old Apple Family recipe. Made only with the finest ingredients available, o’ course. That includes lard. Them fancy cookin’ professors at the university ever teach ya about usin’ real fat in yer pastries? Makes everythin’ taste better, in mah humble opinion.” </p><p>Roz shook her head. “Not really. Would you mind teaching me your techniques sometime?” </p><p>“Sure thing, Sugarcube. But it bears sayin’ that any o’ mah grandchildren could do the same.” </p><p>Roz’s eyes widened in curiosity. “All of you can cook? That’s amazing!” </p><p>Apple Bloom chuckled bashfully while she began deep-frying the chicken cutlets. It happened to be one of the few times that she insisted on wearing an apron. “It ain’t a big deal. Ah think bein’ able ta cook is one o’ those life skills everybody should learn. Comes in handy.”</p><p>Within two shakes of Winona’s tail, supper was ready and plated. Everyone sat down at the table, said a quick blessing of thanks and dug into whatever they wanted first. But not before Roz was given a healthy portion of all the fixings. After all, it was Apple Family tradition to make sure their guest was served before anyone else. Applejack barely sunk her teeth into a chicken leg, when she stared at Roz with a mixture of embarrassment and horror. The curvaceous, pale-skinned woman hadn’t been kidding when she had a healthy appetite. She proceeded to wolf down an entire biscuit slathered in gravy like it was her last meal on earth. </p><p>Applejack grimaced when she went to take a sip of her iced tea. “Why don’t slow down a bit, Roz? Supper ain’t a contest ta see who can snarf down the most food, the quickest. Savor everythin’ first, damn it. Where’d ya learn yer table manners from, a feral hog?” </p><p>Cheeks full like a squirrel, Roz coughed a bit, then chugged some iced tea to wash down however much of the biscuit was still left in her mouth. “I’m sorry, everyone! But I just can’t help myself when it comes to delicious food. My compliments to the chef.” </p><p>Apple Bloom took a bite of her green beans and pointed her fork towards Roz’s chest. “Hey—um—ya got a big ole glob o’ gravy on yer boobs, Roz. Might wanna clean that up.” </p><p>Roz blinked, looked down at her chest, and frowned. “Oh, dear. I know! Come sit on my lap, Winona. How’d you like to lick my chest clean? I’m sure you like gravy, don’t you?” </p><p>Oblivious to her family’s irritated groans, the border collie happily complied with the dark-haired female’s request. Winona didn’t waste a second licking wherever gravy was to be found. Which, given Roz’s rambunctious laughter, meant that she was either very ticklish, sensitive, or both. Mac, in particular, had a difficult time concentrating on eating his food in peace. </p><p>Roz giggle-snorted. “<i>OOOH</i>! Wait—that’s not—stop licking my nipples so much!” </p><p>Mac let out a heavy sigh as he pushed his chair in. “Pardon me. I’ll go git a washcloth.” </p><p>Apple Bloom poked her mashed potatoes and shuffled her feet underneath the table. “Miss Roz, why don’t ya let Winona go about her business? She’s had enough gravy fer one night.” </p><p>“Off you go, Winona. Thank you for helping me!” </p><p>The border collie barked once, and gave Roz an affectionate nuzzle to the cheek.</p><p>Big Mac coughed awkwardly as he handed Roz the washcloth. “Ah made sure it’s warm. Feel free ta use our shower if ya need ta. Towels are in the hall closet…” </p><p>Realization struck Roz like a lightning bolt at that moment. She blushed furiously. “Oh, no. I… made a scene, didn’t I? My apologies, everyone. Please excuse me while I go take a shower.” </p><p>When Roz was finally out of sight, Granny Smith let out a loud belch and patted her stomach. “Mighty fine victuals, y’all! Ah tell ya what, Ah like that gal. She’s got spunk n’ then some! Ya should invite her over fer supper more often, Applejack. Welp, if anyone needs me, I’ll be out in the livin’ room enjoyin’ mah nightcap with a trashy novel.”</p><p>Apple Bloom was the first one to speak when Granny left. “Well, look on the bright side. At least Miss Roz didn’t git any gravy on her lady bits. That would’ve been unbearably awkward.”</p><p>“No doubt,” Applejack reluctantly agreed, “If Ah invite her over again, I’ll have ta insist that she use a napkin. Hell, we might as well make her wear a full apron, given how much o’ a mess she made. Ah can’t believe she’s such a sloppy eater.”</p><p>Mac nodded. “Eeyup. Reckon mah heart couldn’t take it if she did that again. What? Don’t y’all gimme that look. Miss Roz is a perfectly curv—errm—Ah mean healthy, attractive young woman. Hard not ta take a gander at her. Besides, Ah know fer a fact that she was sneakin’ peeks at mah manhood the whole time. Fair is fair, after all.” </p><p>Applejack sighed as she cleaned off her plate. “Sexual tension and shenanigans aside, supper wasn’t so bad. Liveliest it’s been in ages. Ah think Ah will invite her back sometime.”</p>
