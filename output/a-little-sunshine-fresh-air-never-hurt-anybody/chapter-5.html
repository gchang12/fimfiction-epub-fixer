		<h1>Orientations, Old Friends, And Opportunities</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 5</b></p><p>Sweet Apple Acres, Ponyville </p><p>Big Mac softly strummed his guitar as he stared at the setting sun slipping beneath Everfree National Forest. The big farmer sat with his back against Harold, a massive, ancient apple tree that Granny swore her own father had planted when the Apple Clan first settled Ponyville. When he finished working for the day, Mac liked to come up the hill, sit underneath Harold’s robust branches, and contemplate life. </p><p>It was hard to believe but another summer had already slipped away. Below Mac, Sweet Apple Acres’ orchards stretched out, many of their boughs still heavy with plump, ripening apples. By his estimation, it’d take him and his siblings another week to finish harvesting the fruit. Just in time for both of his sisters to return to their studies. The new semester was about to begin. </p><p>He chuckled for a second as he tried to guess which of the two of them were more nervous at the prospect. While both of them put on a front of outward confidence, he knew they had their own fears and insecurities. Even if they were very different. It was times like these he was grateful to be done with schooling for good. At least, until he decided to have children of his own. </p><p>Mac’s thoughts were broken by the sound of bare feet shuffling through the grass. Looking up, he watched as Apple Bloom climbed the hill towards him, wearing nothing but her trusty bow and an anxious expression. The orange-haired giant raised a hand from his guitar in greeting. </p><p>“Howdy, 'Bloom. A beautiful sunset, ain’t it?”</p><p>Apple Bloom blew a few strands of hair from her eyes as she glanced back at the vivid pastoral colours of the sunset, “Ah suppose so. Mind if Ah join ya?”</p><p>“Enope.” Mac replied, patting the ground beside him. While he played a meandering tune, his little sister cuddled up next to him and rested her head upon his shoulder. The two siblings watched the sun for several minutes as Mac waited for Apple Bloom to say what was on her mind. Sometimes, silence was the best way to get people to open up. </p><p>“Hard ta believe that summer vacation is almost over,” the teenager began, playing with a strand of her hair. </p><p>Macintosh’s bearded face cracked into a smirk, “Don’t know how ya can call it a vacation unless ya were slackin’ off with yer chores when Ah wasn’t lookin’.”</p><p>Her comparatively little fist bounced off his chest, “Ya know what Ah mean ya big lug! Seems like just yesterday Ah was freakin’ AJ out by invitin’ Scoots and Sweets over fer a swim.” The two shared a chuckle at the memory. “Now, I’m ‘bout ta start middle school in a week.”</p><p>“Nervous?” Mac astutely asked, fine-tuning his instrument. </p><p>“Well, a little Ah guess. New school and all but at least I’ll be with mah friends.” Apple Bloom rolled her eyes. “Even if one of ‘em is denser than Granny’s fruitcake durin’ Christmas.”  </p><p>“Ah reckon that ain’t the reason ya came up here, though,” The elder Apple observed. </p><p>“Not exactly. Truth is the school is holdin’ an orientation. It’s a chance fer us ta meet our teachers and get to know the layout before we arrive. And on account of ma and pa not...  bein’ around, Ah was wonderin’ if ya could go with me?”</p><p>Mac ruffled his sister’s hair affectionately, “Heh. Need yer big brother ta show ya the best secret make-out spots? Everyone says the band room but truth is-”</p><p>“No, you galoot, I'm serious! Ah don’t wanna go alone…” the teenager sniffed and rubbed her face furiously. </p><p>Mac set his guitar aside and wrapped her in one of his signature bone-crushing hugs. Resting his chin on her head he rumbled, “Course I’ll go, darlin’. But ya sure ya don’t want AJ or Granny ta go instead?”</p><p>“AJ’s got enough on her plate gettin’ ready fer college,” Bloom sighed. “Granny’s goin’ ta be jet-lagged from her trip with the Golden Girls. Besides, Ah want ya to come.”</p><p>“Course I’ll be there. What else is a big brother fer?” Mac remarked, kissing her head and releasing her from the hug. As they settled back in comfortable silence, he added. “Now, ‘o course, the best place ta kiss someone is the roof of the greenhouse…”</p><p>Apple Bloom burst into a fit of giggles. “Mac, yer terrible! Ya know that?”</p><p>“Eyup.”</p><hr/><p>“Are ya certain that I’ll use all o’ these here textbooks?” Applejack groused as she sorted through a pile of the offending pieces of literature on her simple twin bed. Her usually tidy room was cluttered with ‘<i>back to school</i>’ supplies including a box of used textbooks she’d got on the cheap from a second-hand store. </p><p>Perched atop her desk was her trusty laptop with Rarity’s amused face displayed on screen. The fashionista’s hair was tied up in a sensible bun with a scrunchie and a pair of cute <i>(but also the trendiest</i>) red reading glasses perched upon her nose. She wore a plain but still somehow stylish white blouse. AJ supposed, for her, that counted as dressing down. </p><p>Applejack, of course, wore nothing at all. Since reconnecting over the summer, Rarity had expressed tolerance and admiration for her girlfriend’s lifestyle. Although, she had no desire to participate being a naturist herself. For the farm girl, it demonstrated that she could make friends who wouldn’t treat her like a perverted freak for being a naturist. </p><p>Rarity rested her hand on her chin, “Darling, from what my mother tells me, no, not really. Most professors will barely have us crack them open but on the off chance that they do…”</p><p>“Fine,” Applejack muttered. “Better ta be safe than sorry, Ah suppose. Not sure what farmgirl worth their salt would need a whole damned book on ‘<i>crop rotation theory</i>’ fer…” She held up the offending book with a derisive snort. </p><p>“Yes, well you’d be surprised at how many people go into fashion without knowing how to use a needle or thread,” Brightening some Rarity asked. “Classes are only half the college experience, my dear! There’s also the social aspect! Have you signed up for any extracurriculars yet?”</p><p>The farm girl rubbed the back of her head and sighed, “Been busy with the farm…”</p><p>“Applejack,” Rarity warned, “You specifically told me that you weren’t going to use that as an excuse anymore.”</p><p>“So, Ah did. Old habits die hard. Ah was thinkin’ Ah could go ta that club fair they’re hostin’ next week or…”</p><p>“Or?”</p><p>Applejack coughed. “Uh... if that model suggestion o’ yers wasn’t a joke…”</p><p>Rarity clapped her hands together and squealed. “Of course, it wasn’t~ Seeing you <i>au naturale</i> has only strengthened my opinion on the matter. Sandalwood and his classmates would simply love drawing you, I’m sure. Those fetching freckles will be especially challenging and well, your muscle tone is… quite breathtaking, if I do say so myself.”</p><p>Applejack blushed. “Makes me sound like I’m some kind o’ a prize horse or somethin'.”</p><p>“Hardly, my dear,” The fashionista laughed. “More like an exemplary model of womanhood. A salt of the earth maiden, striding through fields of gold wheat-”</p><p>“Sweet Apple Acres is an orchard, ya know.”</p><p>Rarity grabbed a sketch pad and began sketching while she rambled on, “-with the deep blue sky above, a well-worn Stetson. <b>YES</b>! Feminine strength abound! Ideaaaaaa!” </p><p>“Eeyup. Sure sounds that way.” AJ drawled with a crooked eyebrow.</p><p>Her fashion forward friend blushed and hugged the sketchpad to her chest, “Apologies, dear. But when inspiration strikes, it strikes with the utmost vim and vigor! My point is, you’ll love modelling. It’s a great way to meet people. Mingle and so forth. I’m sure you get the idea.”</p><p>“Might as well make it official, then. I’m on board.”</p><p>“Excellent! I’ll arrange for us to meet Sandalwood for lunch this week.”</p><p>AJ scratched the back of her head, “Sure thing, Rares. Lookin’ forward ta it.”</p><p>“Of course, you are! I’ll text you our luncheon date details later on. Now, if you’ll excuse me, the siren song of my muse sings to me. I must heed her advice and <b>DESIGN</b>!”</p><p>“Later,” AJ waved as the video call cut off. She crossed her hands over her abs, looked up at the ceiling, and sighed. “What have Ah got mahself into?”</p><hr/><p>Big Mac felt a wave of nostalgia overcome him while he drove his vintage black charger towards the familiar edifice of Egremont Russet High School. While he preferred driving a practical vehicle most of the time, the charger had been a passion project of his late father’s that had been passed onto him. He didn’t bring it out very often but he figured that his little sister could use the confidence boost of arriving at her orientation in style. </p><p>Apple Bloom fidgeted in the leather seat beside him as she took in the sprawling campus she was about to call her own. She’d chosen to wear a pretty yellow sundress and tied her hair up in a French braid. The teenager was keen to make a good first impression. Mac, for his part, had simply donned a nice pair of jeans and a button-down red polo. In his opinion, if you were going to wear clothes, may as well choose ones that were practical. Style had never been his forte.  </p><p>When he turned into the parking lot, the famer slowed down to allow a group of students and their parents to pass by. Glancing at his little sister he asked, “We meetin’ yer friends over by the statue o’ Ole Moony?” The elder Apple was referring to the black marble statue in the center of the school’s courtyard. It depicted some local legend known only as Nightmare Moon.</p><p>Apple Bloom checked her phone and bit her lip, “Mhmm. They figured we could sit in the auditorium together that way.” </p><p>With a slight nod, Mac turned into a parking spot and turned off the engine. Removing the keys, he slapped his hands on his thighs, “Alright then. You ready?”</p><p>Apple Bloom took her brother’s hand and squeezed it affectionately. “Let’s do it.” The two siblings exited the car with Mac in the lead while they walked towards the school. </p><p>Something of a regional school for the area, Egremont Russet High School consisted of five main interconnected buildings arranged in a rough pentagram with a grassy courtyard directly in the center. The campus included classrooms, a gymnasium, a theatre, a library, a greenhouse, and a swimming pool. Everything a young mind could ever want or need. </p><p>When they entered the school’s lobby, Mac recognized a few familiar faces amongst the chattering crowd. Directing traffic to the auditorium was Old Man Doodle, his old history teacher, who even when smiling seemed grumpy and cantankerous as ever. The scrawny form of Pipsqueak enthusiastically waved at Apple Bloom. A greeting which she sheepishly returned. </p><p>Mac himself raised a hand and waved at the wall-eyed blonde, Derpy, who was showing her own teenage daughter, Dinky, a picture of the volleyball team which she had been captain of. While Mac had often felt like a teenage parent, Derpy had actually become one. By all accounts she’d done a bang-up job as a single mother. It made Mac smile when he saw how excited Dinky was. </p><p>The farmer used his bulk to carve through the crowd. His sister followed closely, the two nodding, smiling and excusing themselves while they walked. After giving a salute to Mr. Doodle, who gave Mac a sour stare in kind, the two siblings made their way to the courtyard. A handful of students and parents were already socializing in small groups. The Apples made a beeline for Nightmare Moon’s statue at the center.</p><p>Sweetie Belle was dressed in a frilly pink dress with rhinestones decorating the trim. Accompanying her was Magnum Belle, Sweetie’s father. A barrel chested, middle-aged man with a thick moustache and slicked back brown hair. He was wearing a dress shirt and an open suit jacket and clasped Mac’s hand in his own as the Apples arrived. </p><p>Apple Bloom blinked her eyes a few times and stared at her tomboyish friend. She was unaccustomed to seeing Scootaloo in a skirt, but tonight she’d decided to wear a dark purple one with a matching blouse. The young skater even wore a pair of amethyst earrings. </p><p>“Wow, Scoots, yah look amazing!” The farm girl gushed, taking her hands. </p><p>Scootaloo blushed, “Gee, ya really think so? I hope it’s not too girly...”</p><p>Scootaloo’s chaperone ruffled her hair fondly as she said, “I told you luv, you look positively cute as a button!”</p><p>“Thanks, Aunt Holiday.” The girl beamed as she and Applebloom went to talk to Sweetie Belle.</p><p>Aunt Holiday was a curvaceous woman with a round open face and bright orange wavy hair. Her figure was due in no small part to her wife Lofty’s baking as she often liked to joke. She was wearing a puffy yellow blouse and her signature blue scarf with a pair of khaki dress pants. Holiday spread her arms wide as Mac approached. Smiling, he accepted her embrace with warmth and affection.</p><p>“Macintosh, dear, it’s good to see you again! How is your grandmother?”</p><p>Mac scratched the back of his head, “Fit as a fiddle n’ full o’ piss n’ vinegar. Beggin’ yer pardon fer the language.” </p><p>Magnum laughed, “That sounds like Mrs. Smith alright.” </p><p>“Mhmm. How’s the missus, Mr. Belle?”</p><p>“Just Magnum, please. Cookie is doing about as well as anyone could expect. We’ve been practicing some of those ‘<i>yoga</i>’ mantras to get in better shape lately. They’re umm,” He glanced at the girls who were still chattering away obliviously. “Quite invigorating, if you know what I mean. Made us both a bit more… flexible during <i>certain</i> activities.” </p><p>Holiday snorted, “I wish I had half the energy of that sheila of yours.” </p><p>“In any case, I just wanted to say how much I appreciate what you and your family have done for Sweetie this summer, Macintosh.” Magnum shifted uncomfortably. “Your lifestyle might seem a bit strange to regular folks but she’s been a lot happier and eating healthier since then.” </p><p>“Likewise,” Aunt Holiday added, “I’ve noticed that Scootaloo has been getting in touch with her feminine side as of late. I can’t help but think that it’s because of Apple Bloom.”</p><p>“Shucks.” Mac muttered. “Y’all give us too much credit. They’re the best friends Bloom’s ever had and that’s the truth.” </p><p>Bloom poked him in the side. “Ya gettin’ sentimental on me, Mac?”</p><p>Crouching down, Holiday smirked. “Course not, luv. Just singing your praises. You look positively adorable tonight!”</p><p>Noticing Sweetie's slightly crestfallen face, Mac added, “Howdy, Sweetie. Aren’t ya the proper lady tonight.” The teenager blushed and smiled sheepishly at the compliment.</p><p>“Rarity insisted that I look like the gemstone I am.” Sweetie replied, imitating her sister’s voice. </p><p>“Sounds about right. Ah reckon we should head to the auditorium if we want ta get a good seat.”</p><p>Holiday nodded, “Quite right, Mac. Come along now girls, let’s be off.” As the group moved towards the auditorium, Holiday led the way gently holding Scootaloo’s hand. Mac and Magnum followed behind Apple Bloom and Sweetie who were discussing how many of their former classmates might be in attendance. Magnum nudged Mac with his elbow. </p><p>“Good summer then?”</p><p>“Mhmm. Had a good harvest and we’re getting ready ta start brewing this year’s batch o’ apple whiskey. Puttin’ the finishin’ touches on the casks mahself.” The farmer replied as they passed Mr Doodle being badgered by Dinky with a variety of questions. Meanwhile, Derpy did a poor job at hiding her laughter while they conversed. </p><p>The older man nodded. “I’ll have to order me some bottles then. The missus and I love sharing a bottle on date night.” He paused. “Speaking of, a handsome young man like you must have a girlfriend by now, no?”</p><p>Mac blushed and coughed, “Enope.”</p><p>“Really? Weren’t you dating Sugar Plum a few years back? Whatever happened to her?”</p><p>“Sugar Belle,” Mac corrected with a sigh. “We dated out o’ high school but nothin’ serious came o’ it. Haven’t had much luck on the datin’ scene since. I’ve been too busy with the farm.” He scratched his chin and smirked. “As ya might well imagine, Granny insists that we all get out there and live a little.”</p><p>Magnum clapped Mac on the shoulder, “Well said! Rarity tells me that’s what Applejack is doing. You should put yourself out there. A man like you would be a real catch. Between you and me, I think Cookie was hoping that you’d hook up with Rarity at some point.” </p><p>The farmer snickered as they entered the auditorium and made their way towards some free seats in the middle, “Unless yer daughter is keen about livin’ on the farm buck nekkid, Ah reckon that our relationship would take off ‘bout as quickly as the Dodge Junction Dingos.” </p><p>At the mention of his favorite football team Magnum went off on a spirited rant as they took their seats and waited for the orientation to begin. Mac nodded along and interjected where appropriate, keen to keep the topic off of his love life, or lack thereof. With a name like ‘<i>Big Mac</i>’ women tended to… expect certain things. Prowess not withstanding, sex wasn’t all that he was looking for in a relationship. Mac wanted emotional intimacy. Something that was far harder to come by but he supposed Magnum had a point. </p><p>After several minutes, the lights dimmed as the school’s band played a jaunty tune. Mac recognized it as the school’s pep rally anthem. The principal, a blonde, severe faced woman known as Mrs. Harshwhinny, took the stage and welcomed the students with a speech he vaguely remembered from over a decade ago. He settled back in his chair and made a face at Apple Bloom, who giggled. Since meeting her friends, his little sister had visibly relaxed and was her usual self once more.  </p><p>“Please join me in welcoming some of our newest faculty members,” Principal Harshwhinny said. “Our new PE teacher, Coach Iron Will.” Mac joined the crowd in clapping for a large, muscular-looking man with pecs that made Mac look positively slender by comparison. “All the way from Manehatten’s Broadway, give a warm welcome to our new drama teacher, Adagio Dazzle.” There were a few wolf whistles as a middle aged woman with poofy golden-orange hair rose and gave the crowd an elegant bow.</p><p>“A heart-breaker if Ah ever saw one,” Magnum muttered as he clapped. </p><p>Harshwhinny smiled as she stretched a hand out to the final new faculty member, sitting just out of sight behind the stage’s curtain. “Last, but certainly not least, I am happy to welcome one of our own alumni from Egremont Russet High School to the team this year. Please join me in welcoming back Ms. Daisy-Mae Cheerliee as our new social studies teacher!”</p><p>Mac felt like he’d been struck by lightning as his old crush walked out and waved at the gathered parents and children. While she no longer wore braces and her frazzled pink hair was now straight and tamed, it was undeniably her. She wore a pink dress and burgundy blazer over her svelte form while her smile lit up the room. </p><p>“Mac, what are you doing?!” Apple Bloom hissed. </p><p>Macintosh realized that he’d stood up and was applauding with a goofy smile on his face. Eventually, Magnum, then Holiday and dozens of others began to rise before the entire crowd was giving Cheerliee a standing ovation. Mac wasn’t sure who was blushing more as he found his seat when it finally died down, himself or his old classmate. </p><p>“How wonderful! It’s community spirit like that which makes our school so special. Tonight we invite you to…”</p><p>Mac tuned out the rest of the principal’s speech as he sorted through his thoughts and emotions. The feelings he’d had for Cheerliee were never made clear to her during his ‘<i>awkward chatterbox</i>’ phase. And then, his parents died, and he wound up having to step in and raise Apple Bloom along with his other sister. Cheerliee, as far as he’d known, had gone to Vanhoover so that she could get her teaching degree. Last he’d heard, she was teaching overseas in Yak-Yakistan. The fact she was back in Ponyville had ignited emotions that he thought were dead and gone. </p><p>After another half hour or so of pumping the students up and highlighting the school’s many features to the parents, the assembly broke up into chattering knots of people. As Mac rose, he caught both Holiday and Magnum giving him knowing smiles. Waving them off, he clapped his hands. “Alright girls, let's go meet your teachers, huh?”</p><p>“Starting with Ms. Cheerliee?” Bloom asked with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>“Boring!” Scootaloo sneered. “Let’s go meet Iron Will! He’s got biceps to spare!”</p><p>Sweetie nodded, “Then we should meet Ms. Dazzle! She was absolutely breathtaking in that reimagining of the Greek tragedy <i>Siren!”</i></p><p>“Looks like we got our marching orders,” Magnum remarked. “Lead on girls.”</p><p>Coach Iron Will enthusiastically shook hands like he was trying to rip someone’s arm off. Mac smiled as he watched the coach explain to the girls all the improvements he had made to the school’s weight room and his plan for the sport's program. When Scootaloo said that she hoped to become a soccer player, like Rainbow Dash, the man produced an enrollment sheet like magic. Mac, Holiday, and Magnum broke into giggles when the man, after being asked how strong he was, casually lifted all three crusaders on a metal bar without breaking a sweat. </p><p>The drama room, meanwhile, had received a complete makeover since Mac’s time with new paint, posters and an avante-garde aesthetic. Up close, Adagio Dazzle was just as breathtaking as Magnum had predicted but had wizened air about her while she interacted with the girls. Sweetie gushed over her passion for musical theater, while the poofy-haired woman listened with a polite smile and answered any questions. Upon hearing that she planned to do a Hearth’s Warming Eve pageant, Sweetie enthusiastically volunteered herself and her friends for the show, much to their collective chagrin. </p><p>Before long, the group arrived at the old social studies classroom. While Bloom and the girls seemed completely at ease, Mac felt nervous. Big as he was, the prospect of talking to Cheerliee again was both frightening and exciting. The farmer prayed that he wouldn’t get tongue-tied or, worse yet, revert to his adolescent habit of chattering aimlessly.</p><p>Daisy-Mae’s personality was on full display from the second you stepped in the door. The walls were painted a soft calming green and decorated with mementos from her time abroad. Including: a Zebrican mask, photos of Yak-Yakistan, and a Vanhoover University scarf. The desks were arranged in a half-circle, with Cheerliee’s in the centre, the whiteboard directly behind. Several shelves crammed with books on world history lined the room and more knick knacks like an antique globe, a bronze singing bowl, and a Neighponese mecha action figure. An unseen scented candle, meanwhile, gave the room a flowery scent.  </p><p>The pink-haired teacher was just finishing up a conversation with Derpy and Dinky when Mac walked in. Daisy smiled warmly as she pointed to her teeth and then back at Dinky’s own. The girl sported a set of shining braces not at all, unlike the ones Mac remembered his old classmate having years ago. As they drew closer, he caught the tail of what the two were discussing. </p><p>“... it’ll be nice not to have crooked teeth anymore!” Dinky chirped. “Mum always tells me that I get all the annoying traits from my dad.”</p><p>Derpy rolled her mismatched golden eyes, “I do NOT say that!. Plenty of your annoying traits come from me.” The mother and daughter giggle snorted in an adorable, near-identical, way causing Cheerliee to laugh herself.</p><p>“Well, I must say you are the spitting image of your mother at your age, save for the clumsiness. Why, I remember one time, she caught her skirt on the door and didn’t realize that her pan—”</p><p>Derpy gently grabbed her daughter and turned her around, “It’s been a <i>BLAST</i> catching up, Cheers. Let’s do more of it over coffee some time, huh?” With a toothy grin, she gently prodded her daughter towards the exit. </p><p>“But Mummmm! I want to hear more about your school days,” Spying Apple Bloom and her friends, she waved enthusiastically. “Hi there Bloom, Sweetie, Scoots! I hope we’re in lots of classes together!”</p><p>“Be sure tah text us!” Bloom called as the two blondes beat a hasty exit. </p><p>“Why hello there,” Cheerliee greeted the three girls with a warm smile. “Welcome to social studies, where we explore the world! I’m Ms. Cheerliee and who are you fine-looking young ladies?”</p><p>“I’m Scootaloo,” The tomboy replied with a blush. “Glad to hear I look ladylike for once.”</p><p>Sweetie Belle gave a half curtsey, “Sweetie Belle, charmed I’m sure.”</p><p>“And ah’m Apple-”</p><p>“Apple Bloom, of course. You’ve grown up quite a bit since I last saw you,” The teacher replied, glancing towards Big Mac with a soft smile. “Macintosh.”</p><p>“Daisy-Mae,” Mac rumbled with a blush. “Howdy.”</p><p>Scootaloo, ignoring the sudden tension between the two, walked over to the bookshelf with the singing bowl on it and picked it up. Examining it she asked. “So what do you do in ‘<i>social studies</i>’ anyway, teach? Looks more like you’re into the ancient artifacts market, like my parents.”</p><p>Holiday strode over to her niece, “Scootaloo, put that down!”</p><p>“Aunt Holiday, I was just looking—”</p><p>“No, no it’s fine. Holiday was it?” Nodding at the plump woman, Cheerliee gracefully took the bowl from Scootaloo. “To answer your question, Social Studies is the study of the world, its history and politics. Through that, we understand ourselves.”</p><p>Magnum shifted and coughed, “I hope you won’t be telling these girls <i>exactly</i> how to think, Ms. Cheerliee.”</p><p>The teacher turned her soft disarming smile on him, “Of course not, Mr. Belle. I simply aim to inform them and teach them how to think for themselves, like any good educator.”</p><p>“Of course,” Magnum replied with an embarrassed chuckle. “Just making sure.”</p><p>“Girls, do you know what this bowl is?”</p><p>“Is it used for fancy salads?” Sweetiee guessed with a shrug. </p><p>Apple Bloom shook her head, “Nah, Sweetiee. Looks too shiny fer that.”</p><p>“She’s right. There’s no way you’d use an ornamental artifact like that for eating food out of. Besides, the markings on the side don’t match any bronze age culture I know.” Scootaloo flushed as everyone in the room turned their attention to her with raised eyebrows. “What?! My parents are real-life archaeologists. I picked a thing or two up from them.”</p><p>“Good eye, Scootaloo. No, I picked the bowl up on a trip to the kingdom of Mount Aris,” Cheerliee remarked as she grabbed a water bottle from her desk and began to fill the bowl. “It’s not only beautiful, but the highest one in the world. There’s a kind of…. sonorous chanting you hear throughout the streets of the old city that I just had to discover the source of.”</p><p>Mac felt himself being drawn in as the girls were, moving forward to hear her words. While she was still cute as a button, it was clear that Daisy-Mae’s teaching skills had been finely honed in her time abroad. With the bowl now half-filled, she produced a stirring rod and placed it on the lip of the bowl. </p><p>“Now, the people of Mount Aris use this bowl in ritual chants and as a way to focus the mind during meditations. They produce a sound like this,” Cheerliee explained as she placed the rod to the lip of the bowl and began to move it around in a circle. Almost immediately, a calming and sonorous note began to be produced, much to the delight of the girls. Their smiles grew even wider as the vibrations caused the surface of the water to dance, with droplets leaping from the surface and splashing back down. </p><p>“That’s so cool, Ms. Cheerliee,” Apple Bloom gushed, &quot;Where else have ya been?”</p><p>“Well…”</p><p>For several minutes, Cheerliee answered a barrage of questions from the girls about her travels. She answered each with good humour and a smile that drew Mac in like a moth to a flame. Magnum and Holiday also asked a few questions about course topics and workloads, but Mac kept quiet. When they finally said goodbye, Mac grabbed Magnum’s arm. </p><p>“Magnum, would ya watch Apple Boom fer me? I’ll be along shortly.”</p><p>The older man winked and clapped his shoulder, “Course I can. We’ll be checking out the science lab.” As their group left, his little sister shot Mac a knowing look, which he waved off with a shrug. </p><p>Cheerliee glanced up from the sink as she emptied the singing bowl into it. Drying it with a paper towel she asked, “What can I do for you, Mac?”</p><p>Mac coughed awkwardly, “Ah just wanted to say hello and catch up, is all. Is that ok”</p><p>“I’d like to think so. We’re old friends, aren’t we?” She replied, placing the bowl back in its place. “You did an excellent job raising her, by the way.”</p><p>“Sorry?”</p><p>“Your sister, Apple Bloom?” She replied, leaning back on her desk. “When I saw her, it really drove home just how long ago it was that your parents had their… accident.” </p><p>Mac joined her in leaning on her desk, “Feels like only yesterday sometimes, if I’m bein’ honest.” The big farmer sighed. “Hell, every now and again Ah still expect mah pa ta come drivin’ up the lane in his pickup, or my ma ta drag mah keister outta bed fer school.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Don’t be. Ya supported me back in the day, Mae. It meant a lot,” Mac smiled sideways at her. “Besides, AB and AJ turned out fine. If you’ll forgive me fer tootin’ mah own horn. I’m mighty proud of ‘em both.” </p><p>Mae placed a finger to her chin, “Applejack has to be around eighteen now, right?” At his nod, she shook her head. “My goodness! We’re getting old...”</p><p>“C’mon, Daisy. It ain’t so bad. Ya look great,” Mac remarked before a blush spread across his face. “Ah mean, um, that is to say ya look… like a proper teacher. Youthful n’ full o’ energy.”</p><p>“Is that how you compliment a lady?” She asked, nudging him playfully with her hip. </p><p>The farmer adjusted the collar of his shirt. “Ah suppose so…” </p><p>With a slight blush of her own, Mae asked, “Is that why you gave me a standing ovation earlier?” Mac studiously examined the far wall. “I’m not upset or anything, I was just… surprised to see you here with Apple Bloom. It brought back a lot of—old feelings I thought were long buried.”</p><p>“Are yer glob-trottin’ days behind ya then?” Mac asked cautiously, pointedly ignoring Ms. Cheerilee's declaration. “And does that mean yer...  lookin’ to settle down?”</p><p>Mae twirled a strand of her hair, “Yes, to the settling down part but I’m afraid there’s just me in the picture right now. As much as I’ve loved seeing the world, I wanted to set some roots down. Stay in one place for a while. Does that make sense?”</p><p>Mac’s heart beat a little faster, “Eeyup.” The chatter of conversation from the hallway snapped their attention towards the door. Mouth dry as cotton, Mac asked. “Mae, if I’m not being too forward, Ah was wonderin’ if you’d want ta catch up over dinner or somethin’.” </p><p>The teacher gave him a smile as she held out her hand, “I’d love to, Mac. Phone?”</p><p>Handing over his phone, Mac contained himself from having a fit of childish giggles. Slender fingers dancing quickly across the keys, Mae tapped out her number and returned it to him. Biting her lip, the woman suddenly leant over and gave him a brief peck on the cheek. “It’s really good to see you again, Mac. Let’s not waste too much time on setting up that dinner date, ok?” </p><p>“Yes ma’am.” Mac muttered as he got up and made to leave the room. When she gave him a little wave, he felt his spirit soar. After collecting himself once more, Mac opened the door and ushered the next group of parents and students in.</p><p>Mac couldn’t help but whistle a little tune when he walked towards the science lab. It wasn’t just AJ putting herself out there anymore. Her big brother was going to show her how it was done.</p><hr/><p>Applejack rubbed her temples as she left her final class’ orientation. The blonde farmer was clad in a flannel shirt, work jeans and a pair of comfortable sneakers. She carried a backpack containing her school-issued laptop and course outlines for the half dozen courses she’d be taking during the fall semester. Adding to her exhaustion was the fact she’d spent her lunch at the student services office modifying her schedule to give herself more flexibility. </p><p>All in all, she was tired, hungry and very much looking forward to grabbing a bite to eat with Rarity and this ‘<i>Sandalwood</i>’ fellow. Following Rarity’s directions, she made her way to a local dive at the edge of campus called: <i>Donut Joe’s</i>. Applejack was hit by the smell of fresh-baked doughnuts, fried food and home cooking as soon as she stepped in the door. Smiling, she looked for Rarity, who eagerly waved her over from a corner booth. </p><p>“How are you today, Applejack?” Rarity after giving her friend a sudden hug, which she returned. “You look as tired as I feel!” The fashionista, predictably, looked immaculate with the right amount of makeup and a sleek purple sundress that hugged her curves in all the right ways.</p><p>“Eeyp. Today was pretty gruelling. Ah don’t know about you, but I’m orderin’ me some grub.” AJ replied, waving down a pretty waitress and ordering an eggs benedict with hash browns and a sugar doughnut. Rarity, meanwhile, ordered brioche French toast and fruit smoothie. They chatted for several minutes about their classes until the third member of their party arrived. </p><p>Upon first glance, Sandalwood seemed to be your archetypal metro-hippie. The young man was tall, fit, and his physique bordered on athletic. His tan skin contrasted with his dark-green dreadlocks while his emerald green eyes were bright and friendly. He wore a pair of stylish tan chinos, aviators, a pink t-shirt underneath a purple dress vest, with a grey rastacap to finish off the look. </p><p>At the sight of Rarity, he spread his arms wide and flashed a pair of white teeth, “Hello, dear.”</p><p>“Sandalwood!” Rarity cooed rising up to meet his embrace. AJ rose as well and blinked as the two embraced and then kissed each other’s cheeks. When Sandalwood turned to her, Applejack stuck out her hand. </p><p>“Pleasure ta meet ya. Mah name’s Applejack.”</p><p>He accepted her handshake with a warm smile, “A pleasure, Applejack. The name’s Sandalwood.” Up close, she realized he could only be described as fruity. His hands were soft and there was a smell of fancy cologne about him, not at all, unlike Rarity’s own scent. His eyes roved over her body in an appreciative, but a non-sexual way. “My goodness! Rarity wasn’t  joking about your figure. You are absolutely breathtaking, dear.”</p><p>“Uhh… thanks?” The farm girl responded, flustered and caught off guard by the compliment. “Yer a pretty handsome fella yerself, Sandalwood.”</p><p>He placed a hand to his chest and chortled. “You are far too kind, Applejack. Micro does always say my best attribute, and outfit, is my smile.”</p><p>“Micro?” AJ asked when they sat down. </p><p>Sandalwood smiled dreamily, “My boyfriend. Computer sciences major here at CU. I’ve been trying to get him to model but he’s a bit shy.”</p><p>Applejack blinked owlishly. “Oh. Ah just assumed by the way you and Rarity greeted each other that  y’all were datin’. Guess that ain’t the case…”  </p><p>The young man laughed as he waved the waitress over, “I imagine we would make a cute hetero couple, wouldn’t we Rarity?”</p><p>The fashionista rolled her eyes, “Please! With your fashion sense, Sandy, it’d never work.” </p><p>“This look is a Sandalwood classic. Micro LOVES it on me. Haha. And taking it off too~”</p><p>After ordering a vegan caesar wrap and a glass of water, the three sat back and made idle small talk as they waited for their food to arrive. In a timely fashion, their meals arrived and the three dug in with gusto. While Applejack wolfed her food down, Rarity demurely nibbled on her French toast daintily, not unlike a little mouse. Sandalwood, meanwhile, took big bites of his wrap but paused to savor the meal while he chewed. </p><p>As they finished their meal Sandalwood smiled, “So, Applejack. May I ask you something?”</p><p>“Sure,” the blonde naturist replied as she bit into her doughnut. </p><p>“Why do you want to model for the art club?” The young man asked bluntly. “Rarity vouches for you but I’d still like to hear it straight from the horse’s mouth, to borrow a country phrase.” </p><p>Applejack bit her lip, “Well, Ah don’t how much Rares has told ya, but I’ve been lookin’ ta expand mah social horizons a bit. Nude modellin’ seemed like an interestin’ way ta meet folks.”</p><p>“Interesing,” Sandalwood remarked, sipping his water. “Now, forgive the insinuation, but you aren’t looking to get a sexual thrill from being seen in the nude by strangers, are you? </p><p>Applejack slammed her fists on the table and sat up. “<b>WHAT THE HELL</b>?!! Ah ain’t some exhibitonist hussy lookin’ ta rev up mah engine in front o’ folks. Lands sakes!” </p><p>Rarity placed her hand on Applejack’s arm “Please calm down for a moment, darling. Sandy is simply testing you.”</p><p>Sandalwood bowed his head, “Forgive my bluntness, but I like to be sure. I take the comfort and safety of my models very seriously. Fair?”</p><p>“Ah suppose so…” The farmer muttered. </p><p>“Now, have you ever been nude in front of other people before? It can be a bit jarring at first, so I’d advise maybe taking your clothes off at home to-”</p><p>“Mah family are naturists, so I’m pretty comfortable in mah birthday suit.” </p><p>Sandalwood hummed, “Oh, I see! Those people who prefer to be naked all the time?” At her nod he smiled. “This is making much more sense now. I assumed a farm girl would be the conservative type. I guess I still haven’t learned that whole <i>book by its cover business</i>.” </p><p>“It’s fine.” AJ affirmed. “I just started openin’ up about that part of mah life recently.” </p><p>“Thank you for trusting me with that info, honey,” The man replied, squeezing her hand. “Now, the Fine Arts Club meets every Wednesday to sketch our models. It usually runs from 4 p.m. until 6 p.m., to avoid conflict with classes.” </p><p>“Sounds about right.”</p><p>The Rastafarian nodded. “This year we have around twenty artists, both men and women, who’ll be sketching you.” AJ felt her stomach churn at the prospect but she kept a smile on her face. “There will obviously be no photographs or videos taken without the model’s consent. As you’ve already seen, I abhor perverts in my studio.” </p><p>“One of his better qualities,” Rarity added playfully patting his cheek. “Not to mention that dashing jawline…”</p><p>“You, of course, shall be compensated for your time. Does $300 a session sound good to you?”</p><p>Applejack nearly choked on her drink, “Three hundred bucks? Just ta sit bare-arsed in front o’ some random strangers?!”  Shrugging at his nod she remarked. “Yer money, ah suppose.” </p><p>“Technically, the university’s money but they can certainly spare it. Now, I was going to model for our first session until I found suitable models for the rest of the term, but you seem very keen on doing so yourself. Would you be alright with starting us off next week?”</p><p>“Ah suppose if I’m jumping into the deep end, Ah may as well dive.” The prospective nude model replied. “If y’all will have me, that is.”</p><p>Sandalwood clapped his hands together, “This is going to be so exciting! I promise that you won’t regret it, Applejack.”</p>
