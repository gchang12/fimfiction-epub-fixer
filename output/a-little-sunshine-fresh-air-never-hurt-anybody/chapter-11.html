		<h1>White Mist Resort (II)</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 11</b></p><p>Main Hall, White Mist (<i>Clothing Optional</i>) Resort</p><p>Roz scampered down the hallway towards the café while Haki and Applejack followed close behind, hand in hand. Just moments before, they’d shared their first kiss and despite the warm, fuzzy feeling that tingled throughout her body, Applejack’s grumbling stomach had rudely interrupted the mood. At least it had given her a moment to contemplate what had just happened. With a disappointed frown, the blonde farmer realized that she was still falling back on old habits. She’d prioritized work and studies over developing her relationship with Haki. Granted, the entire purpose of this trip was to do just that, but it galled her to no end that they’d been dating for weeks now, and hadn’t so much as shared a kiss together up until this point. </p><p>For a conservative, young woman like Applejack, intimacy was a difficult subject to grasp. Just because she was comfortable with her body and nudity in general, didn’t mean that she was confident about expressing her sexual desires. That was another batch of apples, as far as she was concerned. Maybe even oranges. She glanced over at Haki, admiring his athletic physique, and felt her skin become unpleasantly clammy from an outpour of nervous sweat. What was she supposed to say? What was she supposed to do? Applejack assumed that he was experienced when it came to women and wanted to avoid making herself look like a fool at all costs. </p><p>Never in her entire life had Applejack ever felt so naked. Of course, her state of undress applied in the most literal definition of the word, but to her, the sensation was more akin to approaching a situation which she was completely unprepared for. Like if one were to split logs without bringing an axe first. Thankfully, her personal ruminations were cut short when Roz led them to an ornate training room that came straight out of a kung fu movie. Applejack had to admit that she wasn’t familiar enough with Asiatic cultures to understand the writing or the motifs. </p><p>One thing she did notice right away was the nude woman practicing with a fancy spear that had a blade on the end. Despite being in her early forties (<i>an educated guess by Applejack’s reckoning</i>), her body was in spectacular shape. Muscle tone was evident along her legs, back, shoulders, stomach, and especially her butt. Not quite so poignant as a professional bodybuilder but enough to demonstrate her athletic prowess. It came as no surprise that her pear-shaped breasts were petite and firm; they barely moved at all while she swung around the spear. </p><p>Her raven-colored hair was silky smooth, and held in a tidy bun by several decorative pins. When Applejack glanced down towards the woman’s waist, she spotted silky raven hair adorning the stranger’s womanhood. Unlike Applejack’s thick blonde tuft, her pubes were trimmed into a precise rectangular strip. What stood out the most about the woman was her pale skin. Whiter than freshly fallen snow. It made her diminutive, dusky pink nipples stand out by contrast. Across the woman’s shoulder blades was a large, colorful tattoo of a stylized crane with its wings spread out. Applejack shuddered to herself, knowing full well it would have taken countless hours of needlework to etch something of that scale onto the woman’s back. </p><p>Upon their approach, the pale-skinned beauty twirled her spear and placed it on a nearby rack, all in a single, smooth motion. She then padded over to the only table in the room and retrieved a large, white towel. While she was in the process of wiping away the excess sweat from her face, Roz ran over to her and enveloped the woman in a bone-crushing hug. She accepted the embrace readily enough, but Applejack could tell that it was awkward for her. </p><p>“It has been far too long, Aunt Kimi! How I have missed you!” Roz exclaimed excitedly. </p><p>“Yes, a pleasure to see you again, dearest niece. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must clean up after my training session. I’d rather not greet our new guests in such a state.” </p><p>Roz waved her hand. “A little sweat will not bother them. I promise!”</p><p>The raven-haired woman turned her attention towards Haki and Applejack, then bowed. “Please forgive my disheveled appearance, honored guests. My name is Himiko, co-proprietor of this establishment. If you will allow me, I must take a few moments to make myself presentable once more.”</p><p>Applejack offered her friendliest grin. “No worries, Miss Himiko. Take yer time ta freshen up and whatnot. We’re still tryin’ ta take in all the sights o’ this here resort. Roz mentioned wranglin’ up some grub, so that’s where we’re headed next.” </p><p>“Indeed. It is nearly dinner time. Natalia will show you to the café in the meantime.”</p><p>Himiko bowed once more, and began walking down the hall towards the showers. Applejack couldn’t help but notice that Haki had been watching her closely the whole time with a curious expression on his face. A slight pang of jealousy began to bubble up in the pit of her stomach, but she closed her eyes and let the feeling pass with a deep breath. Haki wasn’t accustomed to interacting with other people in the nude just yet, so a bit of ogling here and there was to be expected. Especially when it came to exotic, attractive women. </p><p>Once Himiko was out of sight, Applejack twirled a strand of her hair absentmindedly. “Can’t say I’ve ever met anyone from Japan before. She’s like a porcelain doll mixed with an action figure.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Haki agreed, “I wonder if she’s part of the Yakuza.”</p><p>“What makes ya say that?” </p><p>Haki rubbed his chin in thought. “Japanese women don’t typically get tattoos like that unless they’re being inducted into the Yakuza. It’s part of their initiation. She’s got the body of a trained killer too. Did you see the way she handled that spear? I’m positive she's a Yakuza.” </p><p>Applejack raised her brow and crossed her arms underneath her breasts. “Body of a killer, huh?”</p><p>“Applejack, there’s no reason for you to act that way. It’s not like anyone here is the least bit shy about showing off some skin. Including you, I might add! I thought that was the whole point of naturism. You know, like being comfortable with your own body image? So, cut me a little slack for observing what was right in front of me!”</p><p>Applejack’s shoulders sagged after she let out a heavy sigh. “Yer right. I’m sorry fer gettin’ on yer case, Haki. Ah suppose I’m feelin’ a might jealous on account o’ the fact that I’ve never had a boyfriend up until this point. Ah know it’s irrational, but Ah can’t help feelin’ the way Ah do when ya look at other women. Especially, the nekkid ones! Damn it; I sound right foolish…” </p><p>Haki pulled her into a half-hug. “You’re not foolish, AJ, just… inexperienced. And I’m sorry too. For snapping at you like that. Sometimes, I forget how little you know when it comes to relationships. I’m not saying that’s a bad thing! Everyone experiences certain aspects of life at their own pace. From now on, I promise that I’ll try to be more conscious of your feelings.”  </p><p>Applejack shuffled her feet. “Maybe this ain’t the proper time ta discuss personal matters, but Ah think ya deserve some insight into how mah mind works. If yer serious about us bein’ honest with each other. Because Ah think that’s an important part o’ any relationship…” </p><p>Haki nodded in agreement. “Of course, I am. I believe that too.” </p><p>“Mah folks taught me that everyone’s unique. That a person should never be ashamed o’ who and what ya are. Fact o’ the matter is: I’ve spent most o’ mah natural life wearin’ nothin’ but mah birthday suit. And—um—Pa’s hat on occasion, if ya wanna split hairs. </p><p>“Ah try ta take o’ mah body as best Ah can. Considerin’ it’s the only one Ah got. Eatin’ right, proper hygiene and usin’ skin cream when necessary. Ya know, the usual routine for plenty o’ women out there. But I’ve never been one fer fancy perfumes, dresses, lingerie, and cosmetics. I’ve always been a no-frills country gal, and I’ve come ta accept that ‘bout mahself.  </p><p>“Even so, there are times when Ah can’t help but compare mah figure ta that o’ other women. Dainty gals like Rarity and whatnot. Look at me, Haki! I’ve got more muscle tone than some fellas out there. Mah skin’s all tan and weathered from bein’ outside so much. When it comes right down ta it, Ah feel like I’m lackin’ feminine charm and grace. It’s downright frustratin’!”   </p><p>Haki placed his hands on Applejack’s shoulders, rubbing them gently. Her muscles were incredibly tense for a few moments, but then she began to relax again. “Applejack, I didn’t ask you out because I was specifically looking for a ‘<i>dainty gal</i>’. I wanted to get to know you better because of all the things that make you special and fun to be around! But I’d be lying if I said my interest in you was based on personality alone. When I witnessed you modeling for the art club the first time, I was—uh—captivated by your no-frills country girl charm, let’s say.”</p><p>Applejack blushed furiously, unsure how to respond to such earnest praise. She paused for a moment, rocking back and forth on the balls of her feet until she was able to come up with something to break the awkward silence. “Is that so?”</p><p>Haki chuckled nervously. “Yeah.”</p><p>Still blushing, Applejack looked into his eyes. “Which part o’ me caught yer attention first?” </p><p>Haki rubbed the back of his neck. “Please don’t hate me for saying this but… it was definitely your ass. One of the finest I’ve ever seen! So firm and toned! Then your legs are also—<b>EHEM</b>—sorry. Not a very polite thing to say in front of a lady, but it’s the honest truth…” </p><p>Applejack shifted her gaze downward when she felt something warm brush up against her stomach, giggled, then kissed Haki on the cheek. “Looks like yer lower half is bein’ honest with me too. Not ta worry, Haki; I’ll take that as a compliment. Most sincere a woman can git.”</p><p>Upon the realization that he was standing at full mast, Haki tried to cover up his manhood but not before Roz walked towards the young couple to see what was going on. “Is there something wrong? It looked like you two were arguing and—<i>bozhe moy</i>! Haki, you certainly look happy to see me. I am flattered, but Applejack is your girlfriend, no?” </p><p>Haki blushed as much as a Zebrican could, given how dark his complexion was. Applejack began to laugh out loud, making the situation that much more embarrassing. “I’m sorry that you had to see me like this, Roz. Sometimes, the guy downstairs has a mind of his own…”</p><p>Roz knelt down on her haunches and appraised Haki’s bobbling manhood with a nod of approval. “There is no need to be sorry, my friend. The shape and girth of your erect member is quite impressive to behold. I’m certain that Applejack will have plenty of fun with little Haki tonight when the opportunity arises. By that, I mean in bed.” </p><p>The blonde farmer stopped laughing and began coughing. “Roz! That ain’t none ‘o yer damn business! Matters o’ the bedroom are supposed ta be private between the couple involved.” </p><p>Roz frowned. “I do not seek to meddle in your private affairs, Applejack. I am merely saying that you are lucky to have such a well-endowed boyfriend like Haki. Admittedly, it makes me feel jealous that I do not have a handsome companion of my own during our stay here.”</p><p>“Uhh… well, don’t worry ‘bout what Ah said then.”</p><p>“Aren’t you going to do anything to make his erection go away?” Roz whispered into her ear. </p><p>“Right out in the open where everyone can see?!! <b>LAND’S SAKES, WOMAN</b>!!” </p><p>Roz blinked slowly, slightly confused by Applejack’s outburst. “Is that a no then? If you are not up to the task, I would be happy to pleasure him with my mouth. You have but to ask!” </p><p>Haki’s penis twitched with excitement at the prospect of Roz performing fellatio on him. Even though he was thoroughly committed to his relationship with Applejack, Roz was an attractive woman in her own right. In the end, he decided to diffuse the situation before his girlfriend got upset instead of giving into temptation. “It’s alright, girls. I’ll just walk it off.”</p><p>“Are you certain? It might take a while for you to become flaccid again. And you might accidentally bump into things! I do not know from personal experience, but I have heard that it is terribly painful for a man to injure his dangly parts. Well… not quite so dangly in your case, but you know what I mean.” </p><p>Haki closed his eyes and let out an irritated sigh. “Look, Roz, I don’t imagine that will be a serious problem unless I decide to start running around the resort like some crazed madman.”</p><p>Roz’s expression suddenly grew serious. “You could poke someone’s eye out!” </p><p>Having grown up with an oft naked older brother, Applejack became familiar with how the male reproductive organ behaved in various circumstances whether she liked it or not. While she felt guilty for leaving Haki’s erection unattended (<i>since it was her fault for getting him excited in the first place</i>), there was absolutely no way she was about to do anything untoward… unless it was within the privacy of their bedroom. Even then, to what extent she would go was still uncertain. </p><p>Applejack remembered what happened whenever they went swimming together in the summer. Or more precisely, how Mac’s penis shrank when exposed to cold water. Shrank being a relative term, of course. Diminutive wasn’t exactly the word she would use to describe her brother’s manhood, even under less-than-ideal circumstances. She looked around the room for a bucket of water or ice, in the hopes that the shock of its chilliness would make Haki flaccid again. </p><p>Thankfully, she didn’t have to resort to such extreme measures. After sneaking a quick peek below his waist, Applejack noticed that his penis had softened slightly, becoming semi-turgid. Apparently, the airconditioned room and arguing with Roz had provided enough of a distraction to take his mind off of arousal. When Himiko finally returned with a white towel wrapped around her neck, she shot her niece a puzzled expression. Roz responded with a sheepish grin.</p><p>“What is the meaning of this, Natalia? You were supposed to escort our guests to the café.”</p><p>Roz shrugged. “I’m sorry, Aunt Kimi. I figured it was best to wait until you returned.” </p><p>Himiko removed her hairpins, allowing her silky raven locks to rest just above her shoulders. Applejack marveled at how much younger it made her look, even though she didn’t look that old to begin with. The wonders of a healthy diet and regular exercise, she assumed. With meticulous care, she folded the towel and deposited it in a hamper. The hostess entwined her hands together, placing them just below her navel and bowed once again. She offered everyone a polite smile. </p><p>“Again, I must apologize for my tardiness. Natalia did not inform me when you two were supposed to arrive, so I was not prepared to entertain any guests. For that matter, neither did my dear husband. We shall have words about that matter later. Are you hungry?” </p><p>Applejack’s stomach grumbled in protest, causing the young farmer to chuckle awkwardly. “It’s a bit early fer dinner, but Ah reckon we wouldn’t be opposed ta fillin’ our bellies. Mind mah askin’, Miss Himiko, but what kind o’ food do ya serve ‘round these parts?”</p><p>Himiko motioned for everyone to follow her, and while they were walking down the hallway, she began to explain the menu. “My husband prefers traditional Russian dishes, while I tend to eat Japanese ones. As you might well imagine, a fusion of the two creates some interesting recipes. However, we do offer more… standard fare for our guests. What do you desire?” </p><p>Haki raised his hand. “I haven’t had sushi for a long time. Is that on the menu?” </p><p>“Most certainly,” Himiko replied with a slight nod, “I would recommend the <i>Unagi</i> rolls.”  </p><p>Applejack nudged Haki’s side. “What in tarnation is ooo-na-gee?”</p><p>“That’s the Japanese word for eel. I know it might not sound appetizing, but it’s tasty. Assuming, of course, that the meat is prepared properly. If not, it can be fishy-tasting and greasy. Don’t worry, AJ. I’m sure the sushi chef here is competent.” </p><p>Applejack scrunched her lips together in a sour expression. “Granny’s always tellin’ me that Ah oughta try new things. Sorry, Haki. I’m a country gal used ta country fare. Like apple pie, steak, mashed potatoes, and fried chicken. Sushi doesn’t strike me as particularly appetizin’.” </p><p>“Your grandmother is right. Don’t judge a dish until you’ve tried it.” </p><p>Applejack ran her fingers through her hair and sighed. “Alright then. I’ll give it a shot. But ya can’t force me ta eat any more sushi if Ah don’t like it. Far as I’m concerned, I’d rather eat a hamburger or whatever passes fer normal Russian food ‘round here.”</p><p>Roz poked Applejack’s shoulder to get her attention. “Fret not, my friend! Aunt Kimi is a very talented chef in her own right. She prepares all of the sushi served at the resort. I may be biased, but I can tell you that all the food she has made for me has always been yummy!” </p><p>Applejack raised her brow. “Says the gal with a hearty appetite. Is there any food ya don’t like?”</p><p>Roz pondered for a moment, tapping her chin in thought. “Hmm. That is a difficult question to answer. If I had to choose, I would say beets. My countrymen seem to love them, but I never acquired a taste for them myself. Otherwise, if the food in question tastes good, I eat it!”</p><p>“Beets? Huh, what do ya know about that?”</p><p>Roz shook her behind, making everything else jiggle in response. Haki coughed and tried to divert his attention elsewhere. “Uncle Al says that is why I am pleasantly plump! I am of the opinion that most of the food I eat goes straight to my breasts and bum. Do you think so?” </p><p>Applejack laughed uneasily. “Erm—I’d say that’s an accurate assessment.” </p><p>Roz clapped her hands together. “<b>OH</b>! Don’t forget dessert~”</p><p>“Right. How could Ah? No supper’s complete without it, Ah reckon.” </p><p>Roz wrapped Applejack in a sudden, bone-crushing hug. She grunted at how much strength the goth put behind her embrace. It was like being smothered by a smooth, squishy grizzly bear. Not entirely unpleasant but not comfortable either. “This is why we are such great friends!”</p><p>Before Applejack had a chance to catch her breath, Roz scampered over to Haki and gave him the same treatment. “I have not forgotten about you, Haki! Hugs for all!” </p><p>With every ounce of willpower he possessed, Haki tried to ignore the curvaceous, nude Russian girl currently squeezing the stuffing out of him, and rubbing up against certain, sensitive places. It didn’t help matters that his erection from earlier hadn’t completely subsided yet. “Thank you, Roz. I—uh—appreciate the friendly hug. You can let go now…” </p><p>“Oh, yes! My apologies, Haki. I can get a little carried away sometimes.” Roz said while motioning downward, a slight blush coloring her pale cheeks. </p><p>Haki groaned when he looked down at his waist. While it wasn’t quite as hard as before, his manhood had begun to rise again, pointing forward slightly. It was enlarged enough to be noticeable by everyone around him. “Damn it. I can’t seem to calm down today.” </p><p>Himiko turned her attention towards Haki. “Is this your first-time experiencing naturism?” </p><p>“Sort of. My aunt is a diehard nudist and she introduced me to the concept. I’ve only ever practiced inside her house, and certainly not with anyone else around. I’m sorry, Miss Himiko. Not trying to be a perv or anything, my dick just reacts to certain… things. I can’t help it.” </p><p>Himiko laughed daintily. “Not to worry; your body’s reaction does not offend me. Erections occur for those new to the lifestyle and those who have embraced it for some time. The important distinction, I would say, is to distinguish whether or not it is being exhibited on purpose.” </p><p>“Really?” </p><p>Himiko nodded. “Just ask your lovely companion. I’m certain she has a few stories to tell.” </p><p>Applejack rubbed Haki’s back reassuringly. “She’s right, ya know. Can’t tell ya how many times I’ve caught mah brother in a similar situation. Although, in his case, it’s usually just mornin’ wood. Natural process that. We’ve all seen it so many times, it doesn’t even phase us anymore.” </p><p>“Even your little sister?” Haki asked hesitantly. </p><p>“Ah figure Apple Bloom’s better adjusted than her peers when it comes ta matters like that on account o’ the fact that she was born n’ raised in a naturist household. The human body and how it works ain’t some taboo mystery ta her, as it might be ta other teenagers.”</p><p>Haki subconsciously cupped his hands over his crotch. “Yeah, well… I wasn’t raised that way.” </p><p>“Haki, Ah didn’t expect ya ta git used ta all this in a heartbeat. Take yer time. I’m patient. At the very least, I’m happier than a fly in a fruit pie that ya even considered givin’ mah lifestyle a try.” </p><p>Haki slowly removed his hands and placed them at his sides. “I can’t very well pretend that it doesn’t exist. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have put so much effort into developing our relationship.”</p><p>Applejack frowned and looked down at her feet, shuffling them slightly. “Ah appreciate that. Sometimes, Ah feel like I’m not doin’ enough on mah end. It’s been years since I put any effort into makin’ friends and maintainin’ relationships with folks outside the family.”</p><p>“No one said this was going to be a smooth ride.” </p><p>Applejack nodded sagely. “Reckon not. Alright! Enough drama! Let’s git some grub.” </p><hr/><p>Himiko invited everyone to take a seat around a low-standing table with plush pillows arranged where chairs would normally be. She explained that this was the traditional way for Japanese people to dine together. Furthermore, she reasoned, pillows were much more comfortable for nude guests to sit on than wooden dining chairs. It was logic that Applejack &amp; Haki couldn’t argue with. Roz sat with her legs tucked underneath her bottom while the young couple sat cross-legged respectively. Once they got situated, Himiko brought out a tray full of chilled green tea. </p><p>“Please enjoy some refreshments while I prepare your meals. I brewed the tea myself.” </p><p>While Applejack and Roz took a sip, Haki watched Himiko pass through the curtained doorway into what he assumed was the kitchen. “I don’t mean to sound like an asshole, but isn’t it kind of unsanitary for people to prepare meals in the buff?”</p><p>Roz cocked her head. “My aunt and uncle are very strict about the resort’s sanitation standards. Aunt Kimi always keeps the kitchen spotless, so far as I am aware. You needn’t worry about hair getting into your food, Haki. She wears an apron while preparing any kind of food or drink.” </p><p>“Oh. Makes sense, I guess. Is that something you do while cooking, AJ?”</p><p>Applejack put down her mug and leaned back. “Depends on what I’m cookin’. Fer anythin’ hot, protection is a must. Especially with bacon. If I’m makin’ a salad or the like, typically no.” </p><p>“I imagine it makes cleaning up a whole lot easier.” </p><p>“Darn tootin’ it does,” Applejack agreed, “No clothes ta stain and washin’ up is easy as pie.” </p><p>Roz leaned forward, squishing her breasts against the table unintentionally. When she directed her attention towards Haki, he tried his best to maintain eye contact with her. “Applejack told me that you are an athlete. A swimmer, yes? Is that why you are so smooth all over?” </p><p>Haki cleared his throat and took a sip of tea. “Yeah. It helps reduce drag in the water and makes wearing our suits more comfortable. Do you mind if I ask you a personal question, Roz?” </p><p>“Not at all,” Roz beamed, “We are all friends.” </p><p>“I assume you must dye your hair, right? What’s your natural color?” </p><p>“You will be surprised to know that I am actually a blonde. However, I take great care to ensure that my dye remains fresh and coats everything evenly. I only wish that it was easier to treat my pubic hair. Trimming and fussing over it can be a hassle sometimes. I wonder if waxing it all off completely would be a better option. But then I would look like a child!” </p><p>Applejack raised her mug. “Ah know what ya mean, Roz. Ah keep mine as close ta <i>au naturale</i> as possible before it becomes a wild mess. Apple Bloom takes after me in that regard. Heh.”</p><p>“Indeed! I noticed that she looks and acts quite mature for a girl her age.” </p><p>Applejack smiled. “Ah like ta think it’s ‘because we raised her right. The other part o’ the equation is good ‘ole fashioned genetics. Far as Ah know, all the Apple women have been early bloomers. Eeyup. Puberty hits us like a freight train! Before ya know it, yer ten goin’ on twenty.” </p><p>Roz let out a frustrated huff and flopped onto the table, nearly spilling her tea. “I love Aunt Kimi’s food but she always takes so long to prepare it. I’m soooooo hungry right now!!!” </p><p>“C’mon, Roz. There ain’t no reason ta make such a fuss. I’m sure yer aunt is doin’ the best she can. In the meantime, let’s talk ‘bout somethin’ else ta git yer mind off o’ food. How’s that sound?” </p><p>“Alright. I don’t mean to be difficult but I get cranky whenever I’m hungry. Perhaps I shall go have a look at the fish tank while we wait.”</p><p>Roz hopped to her feet and padded across the room towards a large fish tank situated in the corner right next to the kitchen doors. Swimming inside were a variety of aquatic creatures such as: urchins, eels, lionfish, and a red starfish that Roz seemed particularly amused by. She didn’t tap the glass out of respect for the creatures living inside, but watched them with wide-eyed wonder, talking to them occasionally in Russian.  </p><p>Haki leaned over and whispered into Applejack’s ear. “I swear, she’s like an overgrown child.”</p><p>“Can’t say Ah disagree,” Applejack whispered in response, “Just… try ta be patient with her. Ah realize she can be a bit much at times but she’s tryin’ her best ta make friends.”</p><p>“The main reason I even agreed to this trip in the first place was to spend time with you. And by that, I mean just the two of us. Without Roz interfering. AJ, it’s taking everything I have just to keep my cool. Not only in terms of my temper, but her naked body can be <i>VERY</i> distracting.”</p><p>Applejack sighed. “Does that mean ya have a fetish fer curvy gals?” </p><p>Haki winced, unsure if he wanted to give his girlfriend an honest answer. “Not specifically, but she’s got cushioning in all the right places and her boobs are—uh—well, you’ve seen them. Please don’t take this the wrong way! You’re just as beautiful but in a different way, is all.”</p><p>Applejack closed her eyes and huffed in frustration. “Ah suppose Ah ain’t bein’ fair ‘bout this whole situation. Like Ah told ya before, these here feelings o’ jealousy knotted up in mah gut are impossible fer me ta ignore, Haki. When she offered ta suck ya off, Ah damn near lost mah temper. Had Ah not kept mah shit together, reckon I’d have decked Roz square in the face.”   </p><p>Haki reached over and began rubbing her leg as a gesture of comfort. “I’ll do my best to make it up to you later, ok? We’ll both have to be a little more patient.” </p><p>Applejack took hold of his hand and rubbed her thumb along his palm. “I’m holdin’ ya ta that promise, mister. Otherwise, you’ll be sleepin’ by yerself on the futon tonight.”</p><p>“Sleeping with me on our first date? How scandalous! What would your grandmother think?” </p><p>Applejack rolled her eyes. “This ain’t our first date, ya goober. Besides, Granny is one of the biggest horndogs who ever lived. She’s probably wonderin’ why Ah haven’t jumped yer bones yet.” </p><p>“I’ve actually been wondering about that myself.” </p><p>Applejack blushed slightly and shifted in her seat. “Because I wanted mah first time makin’ love with someone ta be special. So, it’s gotta be under the correct set o’ circumstances. What?! Just because I’m a country gal doesn’t mean that Ah can’t appreciate the nuances of courtship.”</p><p>Haki laughed. “There’s nothing wrong with that. You don’t have to feel embarrassed.” </p><p>“Ah was worried that you’d think Ah was a stick in the mud fer bein’ so conservative.”  </p><p>Haki shrugged. “Naked or clothed, you’re always fun to be around, AJ. Sex isn’t the only thing men look for in a relationship, you know. We can appreciate romantic gestures too.” </p><p>Applejack grinned sheepishly. “Ah wouldn’t really know…” </p><p>Haki nearly fell backwards and yelped in surprise when Roz suddenly invaded his personal space. “Awwww! You two are so sweet and—what is the word—adorable together. Oh! And I wish you the best of luck tonight when your love-making starts! If you need condoms ask—”</p><p>Applejack and Haki were relieved to see Himiko enter the room with a platter of freshly prepared unagi rolls, as they didn’t want to talk about contraceptives with Roz. She was wearing a plain, navy blue apron with a matching pair of slippers. At some point, she’d tied her hair back into a ponytail using a scrunchie, presumably to ensure that it wouldn’t get in the way while she prepared dinner for everyone. Once each individual plate was served, she took off her slippers and apron, then sat on her knees like Roz. She cupped her hands together and said: <i>Itadakimasu</i>. </p><p>Roz followed suit and encouraged her friends to do the same. “We are giving thanks for the food.” </p><p>With that out of the way, Applejack stared down at the plastic chopsticks set beside her plate with a confused expression. She poked Haki’s shoulder to get his attention. “Ah don’t mean ta sound like an uncultured country bumpkin, but where’s the cutlery?” </p><p>“AJ, chopsticks are Japanese cutlery. You eat sushi with them.” </p><p>Applejack scrunched her lips. “By stabbin’ ‘em with it? Seems kind’ o backwards ta me.” </p><p>Haki demonstrated how to use them by picking up a sushi roll. “See? It’s easy. Just give it a try.” </p><p>“If ya say so. Rather just use mah fingers than make a fool o’ mahself.” </p><p>Haki wiped his mouth with a napkin. “I can ask Himiko to get you a fork if you want.” </p><p>“Don’t bother. Ah wanna try doin’ things the Japanese way. Only fair.” </p><p>And so, Applejack did. Or at least, it was an honest attempt. What ended up happening was she couldn’t quite hold the chopsticks correctly and her unagi roll slipped from her grip and plopped onto her thigh. Not wanting to waste perfectly good food, she snatched it with her fingers and popped the entire roll into her mouth. It was a little bit too big of a bite to be considered polite and certainly not the best show of table manners, but at the very least the sushi was tasty.</p><p>Surprisingly so, by Applejack’s reckoning. She expected eel to taste like a snake that had spent too much time slithering around in the mud. Ironically enough, her cousin Braeburn had served everyone fried rattlesnake fritters once on a family trip to Appleloosa. They’d been tasty too but in her modest opinion, the snack was too much effort to make for what little meat the reptile offered. Lots of tiny bones to pick out, and you had to skin and clean the damn thing too. Beef or chicken were a better choice if one wanted to make a decent appetizer. </p><p>Applejack took a gulp of tea, swallowed hard, and offered a sheepish grin. “Sorry if it’s bad table manners, y’all. But I’m stickin’ with mah fingers fer eatin’ these here oo-nag-ee rolls.”</p><p>Roz, of course, used the chopsticks with practiced ease. She giggled while Applejack popped another roll into her mouth. “Whatever is easiest for you, my friend. We shall not judge.”</p><p>Himiko bowed slightly. “I feel as though I must apologize to you, Miss Applejack. I was not aware that you didn’t know how to use chopsticks. Shall I fetch you some silverware instead?” </p><p>Applejack blushed and rubbed the back of her neck. “Nah, it’s alright, Miss Himiko. Ah can git by with mah fingers just fine. Wouldn’t wanna interrupt yer supper on mah account.” </p><p>“On the contrary. It is my job to ensure the comfort of any guest who stays here.” </p><p>Applejack waved her hands. “No, really. I’m fit as a fiddle.”</p><p>Himiko smiled. “Very well, then. Once we’ve had some time to properly digest our meal, I shall bring out some sake with dessert. Natalia’s favorite: Adzuki Mochi.”</p><p>Roz bounced up and down excitedly. “<b>OOOOH</b>~ It has been so long since I’ve had those!” </p><p>Applejack drummed her fingers along the edge of the table. “Look—uh—no offence, but Ah don’t have a clue what those are either. Would ya mind fillin’ me in?”</p><p>“Of course, Miss Applejack. Mochi are a Japanese confection. Sweetened red bean paste filled inside of a rice flower dough coating. They come in a variety of flavors, but adzuki is what we have on hand at the moment. I might be able to make some matcha ones as well, given time.” </p><p>Applejack furrowed her brow in confusion. “Beans ya say? Well, baked beans are a touch sweet and they ain’t too bad, so… Ah reckon this might be ok too. Oh, and fer the record, I’ve never had sake before either. Plenty o’ cider and whiskey, but not that. What does it taste like?” </p><p>“I’m afraid the flavor is difficult to describe. It is of the highest quality, I assure you.” </p><p>Applejack unfolded her legs, stood up, and stretched out a bit. “Mah legs were gettin’ tingly from sittin’ cross-legged fer so long. Pardon me fer a moment while Ah walk around fer a bit.” </p><p>“While you do that, I shall prepare dessert. Unless, you would prefer to wait?” </p><p>Roz raised her hand. “I AM READY FOR DESSERT!!” </p><p>Himiko laughed. “You always are, Natalia. Very well then. I will return shortly.” </p><p>While Haki was finishing up the remainder of his rolls, Roz took hold of Applejack’s arm and said that they both had to use the restroom. Taken aback by the suddenness of her request, Applejack almost dug her heels in and resisted, but something about Roz’s mischievous expression told her there was something else going on. Much to Applejack’s chagrin, when they did make it to the restroom, instead of explaining why they were there, Roz entered a stall, squatted over one of the toilets, and began relieving herself without a hint of reservation.</p><p>“My apologies, Applejack. Green tea always goes right through me! While we were here anyway, I thought it would be more efficient to pee and converse with you at the same time. What is the saying—<i>OH YES</i>—shooting two birds with one bullet.”</p><p>Applejack tapped her foot against the tile floor impatiently and sighed. “I’ll ignore yer zany antics if ya mind tellin’ me why the hell ya dragged me ta the john in the first place.”  </p><p>Once she finished wiping herself, Roz pattered over to the sink and washed her hands. “I wanted to speak to you regarding Haki. Or more specifically, what will happen after we eat dessert.” </p><p>“Go on. I’m listenin’.” </p><p>Roz crossed her arms underneath her breasts and fidgeted in place. “I may not be the most perceptive person, but I know when couples need a little private time together. You and Haki deserve just that, without my interference. I was planning on taking a dip in the hot springs with you two this evening… but I have since reconsidered. Instead, I shall pay my uncle a visit and reconnect with some of my family’s old friends who still work here.” </p><p>A wave of guilt washed over Applejack, making her feel like a selfish jerk. Roz seemed to pick up on this and wrapped her friend in a gentle hug. The blonde farmer returned it sincerely, and rubbed her friend’s back. “Ah appreciate it, Roz. Really, Ah do. With our hectic schedules, Haki and Ah just haven’t had much of an opportunity ta spend any quality time with each other.” </p><p>“That is why I invited you here in the first place, silly!” Roz affirmed. </p><p>Applejack twirled a strand of her hair in-between her fingers. “Right. But Ah mean time together as in the—erm—intimate variety, if ya catch mah meanin’. We haven’t done much beyond the occasional hug, hand holdin’, and up until today… kissin’. Land’s sake, I’m still a virgin, Roz!” </p><p>“Oh, my goodness! I had no idea! I just assumed that you were experienced when it came to matters of the bedroom. I popped my cherry when I was fifteen. Granted, it was not the greatest sex I’ve ever had, but Grigori tried his best to satisfy me. He—ah—did not possess much stamina, I’m afraid. But I’m sure your first time will be far better than mine!”</p><p>Applejack buried her face in her hands and groaned. “Ah can’t believe Ah told ya that.” </p><p>“No! Please do not be upset, my friend. There is no shame in waiting to have sex. In fact, I am happy that you decided to confide in me. Perhaps, I could even offer you some advice?” </p><p>“Advice about what?” Applejack asked hesitantly. </p><p>Roz’s eyes practically sparkled with child-like glee. “How to pleasure a man, of course!”</p><hr/><p>One unbearably awkward conversation later, Applejack discovered many nuances of sexual intercourse that she’d always been too embarrassed to ask her family and friends about. Despite looking at, and being around penises her entire life, she’d never handled one herself, personally. In hindsight, Applejack supposed that she could have asked her older brother at some point, but even amongst nudists, it was not considered anywhere near a polite question to bring up. </p><p>When they sat down at the table, cups of chilled sake and mochi cakes were already arranged at their places. Haki explained that Himiko had to excuse herself, so that she could prepare the baths for any guests who wanted to take one in the evening. Which is exactly what they planned to do after dessert was finished. Or at the very least, Applejack would suggest it to Haki. </p><p>Roz didn’t hesitate to start digging in. She wolfed down a mochi whole, stuffing it into her mouth like a squirrel. Unsure of what they tasted like, Applejack only took a small nibble from the red bean pastry, and found that it was tasty if a bit unusual, texture-wise. She continued to eat the remainder of it, taking small sips of sake in-between. As for the booze, it was cloudy white in color and tasted heavily of rice but had a hint of sweetness to it. Applejack decided that it was pretty good as well. Not as good as oak-barrel aged apple whiskey, but decent enough. </p><p>When Roz finished her last remaining mochi, she took one more swig of sake and excused herself. While she was walking away towards the hall, Roz turned around, shot Applejack a very obvious wink, and gave her a double thumbs up for good luck. Even with all the alcohol clouding her mind, the bronze-skinned naturist found the whole situation ridiculous and rolled her eyes accordingly. Haki looked over at his girlfriend with a curious expression. </p><p>“What was that all about?” </p><p>Face slightly flushed, Applejack scooched closer to her boyfriend, wrapping him in a hug from behind. She rested her head in the crook of his shoulder and sighed. “Don’t ya pay her antics no mind, Haki. We had ourselves an agreement between women. Drawin’ boundaries, as it were.”</p><p>Haki enjoyed the softness and warmth of Applejack’s naked body as she pressed up against him, but he noticed that her skin was warmer than usual. A sure sign that the sake was having an effect on her. He was not immune either; his body felt relaxed and tingly all over. “Boundaries, huh? If that means I get to spend the rest of the night like this with you, I’m not complaining.” </p><p>Applejack cupped his cheeks and planted a sloppy kiss on his lips, giggling as she did so. “Ya better not complain, mister. Man, I’ve been waitin’ a long time fer this. Can’t figure out why Ah hesitated. This is nice. Just the two of us. Alone. Say, Haki. How’d ya like ta take a dip in the hot springs with me? We’re already nekkid, all it’d take is walkin’ in, Ah reckon.” </p><p>Emboldened by the affection she was showing, Haki turned around. Now face to face with his lover, he decided to take a chance and cupped her breast. It was full enough to play with but small enough to fit comfortably in the palm of his hand. He massed it gently while tugging on her nipple in-between his fingers, coaxing an adorable moan from Applejack. “For the longest time, I wondered how sensitive your boobs were. Since there’s not a lot of fat built in them…” </p><p>Applejack giggle-snorted, knowing full well how un-sexy it sounded. She let herself enjoy the massage for another moment, then placed her hand on Haki’s chest, feeling his heartbeat. “They’ve always been that way. Ever since they first started growin’. Makes wearin’ a bra damn-near impossible, on account o’ the fabric rubbin’ up against mah nipples. S’not like Ah gotta worry about mah boobs bouncin’ ‘round like Roz’s. Plenty o’ muscle ta keep ‘em in place.” </p><p>Haki slid his hand down towards her muscled abs and rubbed them appreciatively. “C’mon, AJ. You should know by now that I love your body just the way it is. Every. Single. Inch of it.”</p><p>“Hold on there, cowpoke. Ah like where this is goin’ but we should take a bath first.” </p><p>Finally noticing his semi-turgid erection, Haki stood up and stretched out his legs languidly. “I don’t think the management would appreciate it if we fucked in the hot spring. Too messy.” </p><p>Applejack punched his arm playfully. “Not implyin’ that we will, ya horndog. Besides, I’m pretty sure there are strict rules against havin’ sex in there anyways. Don’t ya worry none, Haki. There will be plenty o’ time fer gettin’ frisky in our room afterwards.” </p><p>Haki helped her up and looped his arm with hers. Together, they started to make their way out of the café and towards the hot spring. “Is that a promise? If so, I’m definitely holding you to it.” </p><p>Applejack leaned over and kissed his cheek. “Is it. Just don’t expect me ta blow yer mind.” </p><p>While they were in the changing room, Applejack grabbed a wooden basket and filled it with all of the toiletries they might need. Natural soaps, a pair of sponges, and a little bit of scented oil to enhance the water. Haki grabbed a couple of towels and followed his girlfriend out to the main bathing complex. There was a wooden fence built around it to ensure privacy for guests, but it was completely open to the air. </p><p>The hot spring itself looked like an oval-shaped pool lined with grey stone, and the water was tinted a faint amber color. A sign posted near the door assured guests that the coloration was normal due to the high mineral content. Supposedly, it claimed, the minerals had many health benefits that ranged from skin care to relieving muscle pain. Applejack wasn’t sure about all that but she did appreciate a nice, hot soak after a long day. And so, she dipped her big toe into the water and found its temperature to be ideal. Hot but not enough to feel uncomfortable. </p><p>She waded into the water until it reached just above her breasts, and leaned up against a ledge. Haki soon followed, wrapping his arm around her shoulders while they sat together and enjoyed how good the water felt. A moment of comfortable silence stretched between them while they washed each other with a sponge, neither feeling the need to say anything, both content to be in each other’s presence. The sky above them was transitioning from evening to night, and the crescent moon was just starting to light up.   </p><p>Applejack poured some oil into the water and took in a deep breath. “Pretty night, ain’t it?” </p><p>“Made all the better by who’s sharing it with me.” Haki replied lazily. </p><p>“Mhmm. Reckon so.”</p><p>Haki rubbed his fingers along Applejack’s back affectionately. “About what you said earlier. Your promise, I mean. I just want you to know that I’ll try to be gentle and take my time. It won’t be easy holding back because I haven’t slept with anyone in a while but—”</p><p>Applejack climbed on top of his lap and straddled him, wrapping her arms around his neck. “Listen up, Haki. Because I’m only gonna say this once. Even with all the sake in mah system keepin’ me loosey goosey, I’m still nervous as hell about havin’ sex with ya. But Ah want ya ta know that I’m eager and willin’ ta learn, even if there’ll be some bumps along the road.” </p><p>“I don’t want you to feel nervous about it. What can I do to help ease your mind?” </p><p>“Nothin’ really,” Applejack affirmed, “What ya said before is proof enough fer me that yer serious about our relationship. Ah just gotta grab the bull by the horns and buck up.” </p><p>Haki frowned. “You’re missing the point, AJ. I want you to enjoy having sex with me, not treat it like some archaic form of obligation. If you don’t want to go through with it, then we can try—”</p><p>Applejack poked his chest and pouted. “<b>I WANNA HAVE SEX WITH YA DAMN IT</b>!!” </p><p>“Ok, I get it! Just keep your voice down. The whole resort probably heard you…” </p><p>Applejack giggled while she played with Haki’s hair. “Let ‘em hear. It’s high time Ah ascended the stairs of adulthood and became a woman.”</p><p>“Losing your virginity doesn’t define your womanliness—hood, or whatever. As far as I’m concerned, you’re already a mature adult. More than I am, in fact. You run a farm, go to college, help raise your little sister, and live the way you want. That’s pretty damn amazing, Applejack.” </p><p>Applejack’s cheeks flushed pink at the praise. Part of it was also the alcohol and the hot water. “Yeah, well… that’s always how it’s been fer me. Gotten used ta mah responsibilities by now.” </p><p>Haki pulled her in for a slow, sensuous kiss. Instead of hesitating, Applejack explored his mouth further by wrestling her tongue with his, in a constant battle for supremacy. When they finally pulled apart, the young couple were panting, and excited. Although the water was hot, Applejack could still feel Haki’s erection rubbing up against her thigh, its heat distinct from her surroundings. She reached down in-between her legs and grasped his penis for the first time. Applejack ran her fingers along the rigid, pulsing shaft gingerly, not wanting to cause him pain. </p><p>“So, this is what I’ve got ta work with. S’real sturdy n’ thick. Lord all mighty. Ah don’t… know if I’m gonna be able to accommodate ya when push comes ta shove. At least Ah don’t have ta worry about breakin’ mah hymen. Happened years ago. Comes with workin’ on the farm.” </p><p>Haki grunted when Applejack carefully squeezed his head in-between her finger and thumb. She marveled at how soft and spongy it was compared to the shaft of his penis. A tiny bead of precum formed on the tip, and she played with it, fascinated by the sheer stickiness even underwater. “Can you please stop doing that? The tip is super sensitive to any kind of direct stimulation. I don’t know if I’ll be able to calm down before we make it to the room.” </p><p>Applejack climbed off of his lap and scooted further away. “Ah swear Ah didn’t mean ta push any boundaries. Ah was just curious about how yer… pecker worked in the upright position and—uh—how it felt in mah hands. I’ve been ‘round nekkid men mah whole life and never thought ta touch one before. Ironic, huh? Show’s how inexperienced Ah am.” </p><p>“Not really that complicated, AJ. Peg X goes into Slot Y.” Haki dryly remarked. </p><p>Applejack crossed her arms underneath her breasts and huffed. “Don’t patronize me, Haki.” </p><p>“I’m sorry. That didn’t come out right. I just don’t appreciate getting blue-balled by a certain, sexy, blonde naturist who happens to be sitting next to me. Look, AJ, it’s been a while since I had sex proper, so I’m pretty eager to have a go. Not with just anyone! But you specifically…” </p><p>Applejack blinked owlishly. “What in tarnation does ‘<i>blue-balled</i>’ mean?”</p><p>Haki shifted uncomfortably. “It means that you get teased without being satisfied.” </p><p>Without warning Applejack stood up, causing the water to slosh everywhere. She knelt down, scooped up her boyfriend princess style, and began carrying him towards the exit. For his part, Haki felt too mortified and confused to put up any kind of protest. Not only was it embarrassing to be carried around by a girl (<i>even if she happened to be a really strong one</i>), but his erection hadn’t subsided in the least. It bobbled around while they walked, pointing proudly to the sky. </p><p>They were midway down the hallway when Haki decided to say something. “What if someone sees me like this? Us… like this? I don’t—it’s not proper. I really should cover myself up.” </p><p>“Then they’ll see us. Ya wanted ta have sex with me, so that’s what we’re gonna do!” </p><p>Thankfully, there weren’t any other guests around to notice their shenanigans. Haki breathed a sigh of relief, grateful that he didn’t have to awkwardly explain what was going on, or why he had a raging boner. Applejack was surprisingly gentle when she laid Haki down on the futon. She looked down at her lover expectantly, hoping that he would offer some advice as to what would happen next. With no answer forthcoming, Applejack got on her hands and knees and began to crawl towards Haki like a panther on the prowl, a sultry smile spread across her lips. </p><p>Haki didn’t think he could get any harder, but his penis twitched at the sight of Applejack’s assertiveness. She leaned forward and started kissing his neck. “What do ya want me ta do?” </p><p>“This is going to sound a little strange, but trust me. It’ll work out. Turn around so your ass is directly in front of my face. Uh… that way you can suck my cock while I eat you out. It’s called sixty-nine. Not sure if you’ve heard of the position before but that’s what people call it.”</p><p>Applejack assumed the position hesitantly, knowing that she was giving Haki an unobstructed eyeful of her unmentionables. She relaxed a little, and took in the sight of his stiff penis. It was close enough to her nose that she could smell the manly aroma of his scent mixed with soap. Applejack licked her lips in anticipation, wondering what it would taste like, and if she could even fit the damned thing in her mouth. A tingling warmth filled her loins. She froze in place.</p><p>Haki marveled at his lover’s toned ass cheeks. He didn’t hesitate to grab them, and pry them apart, revealing the dusky wrinkled pucker nestled inside. The rim was a shade of tan darker than her skin, but transitioned to pale pink beyond. Haki simply couldn’t resist the temptation. He buried his face in-between her cheeks and probed Applejack’s asshole with his tongue, causing her to let out an adorable whimper-like yowl. As expected, it was clean and tasted slightly salty. </p><p>“Haki…. w-what are ya doin’ back there?! That’s mah… butthole! Stop! It ain’t clean!” </p><p>Haki paused for a moment and laughed. “There’s not a single part of you that’s dirty, AJ. Besides, we just took a bath, remember? Otherwise, I probably wouldn’t have stuck my tongue there. Don’t worry; it’ll only get better from here.” </p><p>Blushing, Applejack sighed. “Alright. Just warn me next time, ok?”</p><p>The blonde farmer wasn’t prepared for what happened next. Haki switched his attention to her pussy, using his fingers to spread out her salmon pink folds for easier access. Lewd slurping noises commenced almost immediately, as Haki enjoyed the flavor of Applejack’s arousal. It was both earthy and sweet at the same time. Probably because she ate so many fruits and vegetables. The smell though, was incredibly musky. He swirled his tongue inside her more aggressively while rubbing her clit at the same time with his thumb. She arched her back and moaned in response, as a fresh wave of her arousal coated his face. </p><p>Applejack could barely concentrate on Haki’s penis considering what he was doing to her. But she had to. She grasped the root of his penis, right where his balls were connected, and stretched out the skin of his circumcised shaft. She leaned forward, ever so carefully, and opened her mouth to accommodate him. Applejack tried sucking a little bit at first, just to get the hang of it. Much to her surprise, his penis didn’t taste like much of anything. While she bobbed her head up and down methodically, she made sure to take in a breath or two, lest she gag and choke. </p><p>Now accustomed to his girth, Applejack grew more confident with her ministrations. With a slick pop, she released his cock from the confines of her mouth, began using her fingers to stroke the shaft, while she fondled his smooth balls with the other hand. Haki must have been enjoying it because he wriggled underneath her, panting every so often. She smiled to herself. </p><p>It wasn’t long before Applejack was overcome by a haze of lust and the need to please her lover; she took his entire length into her mouth as deep as it could go and bobbed her head as fast as she could, swirling her tongue around his head intermittently. Given that Haki had gotten excited so many times over the course of the evening, it was inevitable that he wouldn’t last long. </p><p>Applejack was encouraged by what she heard and continued to slurp away with reckless abandon. Without so much as a warning, Haki pushed his hips upward, let out a loud grunt, and released his sticky load down Applejack’s throat, nearly making her gag in the process. She tried her best to swallow as much of it as she could, but the taste wasn’t exactly pleasant. His cum reminded her of squid and the smell was overwhelmingly pungent. Moments later, her body went limp like a wet noodle when another orgasm radiated from her belly all the way to her toes. </p><p>The young couple paused for a few moments, panting, and trying to catch their breath. Applejack finally mustered the strength to sit up and looked over at her lover. He was still lying on his back, skin glistening with sweat, and penis had begun to go limp again, leaning slightly to the side. She took the opportunity to cuddle up next to him and rest her head on top of his chest. </p><p>Haki ran his fingers through her hair while they snuggled. “Sorry about not giving you any warning earlier. I couldn’t help myself. It felt too good.” </p><p>“I’ll forgive ya this time. Reckon I’ll need another minute or two before I’m ready fer the main show. At the very least, we should drink some water first.” </p><p>Luckily, there were a few complimentary bottles of water stored in the mini fridge, which Applejack and Haki took full advantage of. While they rehydrated, Haki plodded into the bathroom and relieved himself. It gave Applejack time to reflect and prepare herself for what was coming next. They were really going to do it. To join as one; the most intimate act a couple could perform together. Applejack gathered her courage before Haki returned to bed, and got onto her hands and knees, rump pointed upward as a way of presenting Haki with his prize. </p><p>Her seductive pose did not go unnoticed. Haki stood at the foot of the bed and swallowed hard, squeezing Applejack’s firm, muscular butt cheeks. Within seconds, his penis slowly began to rise once more. “I don’t think I can possibly say this enough, AJ, but you have a dynamite bod.” </p><p>Applejack wiggled her rump, blushing at the praise. “Don’t sell yerself short, Haki. There’s plenty Ah like about yer body too. Just—erm—be gentle when ya git started…” </p><p>Haki grasped his shaft while rubbing the tip of his penis along Applejack’s glistening, pink folds. She was plenty wet from before, so he slipped right into her with very little effort. In response to being filled so thoroughly, Applejack whimpered, taking a moment to grow accustomed to his girth. Even with the passage of time, it felt as though she was being stretched out to the limit.</p><p>Haki placed one hand on his lover’s hip and the other along her lower back, stroking it gently as a gesture of comfort. If he was being honest with himself, the inside of Applejack’s pussy was far tighter than he could have possibly imagined. It felt like his entire penis was being squeezed by a hot, velvety boa-constrictor. “Are you ok? I can pull out if it hurts too much.” </p><p>“S’lot ta take in. Yer pecker’s so damn thick! I’m ok… start movin’ when the mood strikes.”  </p><p>Haki gripped both sides of Applejack’s hips and started thrusting forward. For her part, she moaned softly while gripping the bed sheets, too embarrassed to let him see her face. In time, the young couple were able to find a rhythm that suited them both, as the sounds of flesh meeting flesh, and the occasional moan pervaded the air. Every so often, Applejack could feel Haki’s balls brush up against her backside. They weren’t quite as robust as her brother’s (<i>she couldn’t recall any man’s who were</i>), but she had to admit that she’d enjoyed their smoothness. </p><p>Haki panted heavily. Ashamed as though he was to admit it, he’d reached his limit. Fucking a fit farm girl like Applejack was a lot of hard work, and while he was no slouch when it came to physical endurance, her ridiculously tight, supremely slippery snatch was trying to milk his balls dry every second he slid into her. When she started to have another orgasm, it only became tighter. Applejack moaned aloud, far louder than she had before, showing how intense it was. </p><p>With his own impending orgasm just moments away, Haki gripped her hips, and pushed his penis into her as far as it could possibly go, until his balls were touching her lips. The world around him became nothing more than a blurry haze of immense pleasure, as he filled her womb to the brim with his seed. Once he was finished pumping, the couple collapsed on top of each other in a sweaty pile of limbs. When Haki regained some of his composure, he rolled over to the side of the bed, his slick penis sliding out of Applejack and coming to rest sideways across his stomach. Applejack rolled onto her back; legs spread apart into a V-shape. </p><p>The blonde farmer reached over and entwined her fingers with Haki’s. “Ah suppose that’s one way to lose yer virginity. Mercy… ya sure did fill me up good. There’s still some of yer baby batter leakin’ outta mah cooter. Maybe another bath is order once we rest up a bit.” </p><p>A cold knot formed in Haki’s gut. “Oh shit! I got caught up in the heat of the moment and forgot to wear a condom. Not only that but I didn’t bother pulling out…” </p><p>Applejack giggled. “Good thing Ah was the responsible one, then. Don’t sweat it, Haki. I’ve been takin’ birth control pills fer a while now. Helps ta take off the edge durin’ mah period. Not sayin’ I’d mind bearin’ yer children eventually, it’s just that… we’d have ta git married first.”</p><p>“Right. I should have known. I don’t think I’m quite ready to talk about marriage.” </p><p>Applejack rolled onto her side and stroked Haki’s abs. “We got plenty o’ time fer considerin’.”</p><p>“For what it’s worth, I think you’d make an awesome wife and mother.” </p><p>“Maybe so,” Applejack agreed, “But Ah ain’t ready fer all o’ that just yet either, sugarcube.”</p><p>“Fair enough. Would you be interested in round two at some point?” </p><p>Applejack raised her brow and snorted. “I’m game but we’re takin’ a rest first. No ifs, ands, or buts about it, mister. Surprised there’s anythin’ left ta squeeze outta those balls o’ yers.”</p><p>Haki scooted closer to Applejack, wrapped his arms around her back, and entwined their legs together. He brushed back her messy blonde hair, and kissed her forehead. “Dryer than a desert, thanks to you. But that’s ok. It’ll give us some time to snuggle and… hydrate.” </p><p>Applejack wrinkled her nose in disgust. “Don’t forget shower. We smell pretty ripe.”</p><p>“We’ll play it by ear. On the bright side, at least we don’t have to worry about clothes getting in the way while we’re here. Maybe there’s something to this whole nudism thing. It’s convenient.”</p><p>“Just when it comes ta sex, ya mean?” Applejack asked. </p><p>Haki chuckled. “Well, I can’t deny that. But I will say it has grown on me somewhat.” </p><p>Applejack yawned and scratched her pubes languidly. “Best answer Ah could expect from someone who ain’t accustomed ta the lifestyle. Fer now, let’s keep on snugglin’ and then we can shower up. After that, Ah reckon sleep will follow soon enough. Sound like a plan?” </p><p>“Sounds like one to me.”</p>
