		<h1>Spa Date With Rarity</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 16</b></p><p>The Mean Bean Café, Ponyville</p><p>Applejack drummed her fingers against the table impatiently while she checked her phone. The display read twelve fifty, only ten minutes prior to the art club’s pre-arranged meeting time for the day. Since she often prided herself on being punctual (<i>religiously so some would claim</i>), Applejack was slightly annoyed to find that no one else had shown up for the meeting yet. With a huff of frustration, she crossed her arms underneath her breasts and scowled. </p><p>Haki did his best to reassure his irate girlfriend by rubbing her back. “Try not to get too worked up about it, AJ. We got here fifteen minutes early, after all. Relax and enjoy your coffee.” </p><p>“Ah know. Sorry fer bein’ such an Antsy Nancy. Patience ain’t exactly mah highest virtue.” </p><p>Haki sipped his latte and sighed. “Did Rarity give you any indication what this was about?” </p><p>“Not really. Mentioned it was some kind o’ special project. Yer guess is as good as mine.” </p><p>Rarity and a petite woman with flowing pink hair entered through the door and waved as they placed their orders with the barista. The woman in question was a former classmate named Fluttershy that Applejack hadn’t seen nor heard from since high school graduation. To Applejack’s knowledge, she wasn’t a student at Canterlot University, thus had no direct involvement with the art club. The blonde farmer furrowed her brow in confusion as she took another sip of coffee from her mug. Something wasn’t adding up, but Applejack withheld her judgment until the fashionista had a chance to explain the situation properly. </p><p>Rarity sat down first, with Fluttershy taking a seat across from Applejack. About ten minutes later, Tree Hugger, a mellow-minded hippie with dreadlocks and a knack for painting, along with the art club president, Sandalwood, arrived after ordering drinks, taking their seats around the table respectively. After a brief round of introductions to everyone, Fluttershy went on to explain why she was present at the art club’s meeting.   </p><p>“For those of you who don’t know, I’m studying to become a veterinarian. Part of my curriculum this semester involves interning at the local animal shelter here in Ponyville. It’s pretty far away from Cloudsdale Medical Institute, so I’ll be staying with Rarity for the time being.” </p><p>Applejack cleared her throat. “That’s all well n’ good, but this here is an art club meetin’ fer Canterlot University students. Not tryin’ ta sound rude, just doesn’t make a lick o’ sense ta me.” </p><p>Fluttershy blushed and fidgeted in her seat. “Oh—um—sorry. I’ll get straight to the point then. The shelter… derives its funds primarily through donations. The manager was having trouble coming up with ideas for a new donation drive. After a discussion with Rarity the other day, she mentioned that the art club could help. I was wondering if all of you would volunteer?”  </p><p>Sandalwood shot a sour look at Rarity, in response to which she smiled sheepishly. “While the cause is certainly a noble one, I think we can all agree that more details are necessary before an informed decision can be reached. What would you have us do, Miss Fluttershy?” </p><p>“Painting is one of my hobbies. I’m not a professional by any means, but I was hoping that we could collaborate and create a bodypainting exposition together! Just so everyone is aware, the models are required to be… n-naked. I’m sorry if the concept offends anyone! Rarity thought that showing off a little skin would help attract more attention. Specifically, we would be using two male/female pairs to represent exotic animals. If that’s not too much to ask…” </p><p>Rarity abruptly raised her hand. “Fluttershy is one of my dearest friends, so I shall volunteer to be one of the female models, erm—despite some reservations on my part. Applejack, darling, would you mind being my counterpart? I assume that since you’ve done some nude modeling for the art club already, splashing on a bit of paint wouldn’t be that much of a stretch. Please say yes! I’d consider it a personal favor. If nothing else, think of those poor animals in need!”  </p><p>Applejack rubbed the back of her neck, suddenly uncomfortable at being put on the spot. “Ah suppose there ain’t no harm in doin’ somethin’ a little different from mah usual arrangement with the club. That bein’ said, who exactly do ya have in mind fer the male models?”</p><p>“To be perfectly honest, I hadn’t quite gotten that far. That’s part of the reason why I wanted to gather everyone in one place, so that we could hash out the details, as it were.” </p><p>Sandalwood leaned over to discuss something with Tree Hugger and when they finished talking, he took in a deep breath and blew it through his lips. “I’ll be one of the male models. After all, it would be silly if the president of the art club didn’t participate in some fashion. That leaves us with two more issues: the remaining male model, and who shall be painting whom.” </p><p>Fluttershy blushed even harder than before and made an adorable squeaking sound before raising her hand. “Please pardon my interruption everyone. But I-I don’t think I’d feel comfortable painting any the male models. It would be too… embarrassing for me. If it’s alright with everyone, I’ll stick to painting the female models instead. Sorry. I’ll be quiet now.” </p><p>“Tree Hugger, are you comfortable with painting the male models?” Sandalwood asked. </p><p>“Sure dude. Makes no difference to me.” The hippie replied nonchalantly. </p><p>“Alright. That solves one problem. What about the remaining male model? Any ideas?” </p><p>“Haki, how’s ‘bout ya partner up with me?” Applejack suggested while nudging his ribs. </p><p>“You can’t be serious!”</p><p>Applejack arched her brow. “Why would Ah joke ‘bout somethin’ like this? You’ve got nothin’ ta be ashamed of and I’ll be right there beside ya. Fer moral support n’ whatnot. C’mon! It ain’t a big deal. Just think o’ how much you’ll be helpin’ out all o’ them downtrodden critters.”</p><p>Haki let out a heavy sigh while looking down at his empty cup. “AJ, this isn’t the kind of decision I can make on the spot. Give me some time to think it over, at least.”</p><p>“But who else—”</p><p>Rarity placed her hand on Applejack’s shoulder. “Let’s not push the issue, hmm? We still have a few days until the exposition. Plenty of time to work out all the details.”</p><p>“Fine,” Applejack relented, “Ah know when ta back off.”</p><p>“Splendid! Next on the agenda is scheduling a spa date for the both of us!” </p><p>“A what now?” Applejack inquired. </p><p>Rarity waved her hand and chortled. “We’re going to need to look our best before the paint is applied to its canvas, so to speak. Applejack, you are aware that your privates will need to be completely waxed to ensure the best result… right?” </p><p>“Ya mean I’ll have ta git rid of mah bush?” </p><p>“That’s the idea, darling. Pubic hair is far too thick and would ruin the aesthetic, if painted over. Not to worry! The attendants at the spa are consummate professionals. Brazilian waxes are nothing to be afraid of, I assure you! In fact, I’ve had several of them done in the past few months. You’ll be smoother than a baby’s bottom by the time they’re finished.”</p><p>Applejack frowned. “Ah dunno, Rares. Won’t it make me look childish?” </p><p>“A little tuft of hair isn’t what makes you a woman, Applejack.”</p><p>“Ah suppose not but—hell’s bells—I’ll never hear the end of it from mah family. Especially Apple Bloom. She’ll crow on fer days ‘bout how she’s more mature than her older sister.”</p><p>Rarity rolled her eyes. “If it’s that much of an issue, then we can find another model.”</p><p>Applejack shook her head. “No, Ah made a commitment and I’m stickin’ ta mah guns.” </p><p>“I’ll hold you to it, darling. Later on, I shall text our appointment details.” </p><p>Beyond who would stand in as the second male model for the exposition, the art club’s agenda was fulfilled. As such, Sandalwood announced that everyone could go their separate ways and would provide updates on the situation via a group email. Haki and Applejack were the last to linger at the table, neither able to clear the awkward tension that had begun to form between them. Hands gripping her coffee cup, Applejack grimaced and looked over at her boyfriend. </p><p>“I’m sorry, Haki. Ah shouldn’t have been so pushy ‘bout the exposition. After we had such a great time at White Mist, Ah thought ya were takin’ a shine ta hangin’ out nekkid with me.” </p><p>Haki reached over and placed his hand on her thigh, stroking it gently. “I did have fun at the resort. But you have to understand that our vacation was under very specific circumstances. Modeling in front of complete strangers just isn’t something that I feel comfortable with yet.”</p><p>“Fair enough. Promise me that you’ll at least consider bein’ mah partner. It’d make the whole experience a helluva lot more tolerable fer me if ya did. ‘S all Ah ask.”</p><p>“Tolerable? You make it sound as though you don’t want to model at all.” </p><p>Applejack let out a huff of frustration. “Ah didn’t mean it that way! Ya wanna know the truth? I’m nervous. Sittin’ in front o’ a handful o’ college students ain’t a big deal. But Ah reckon the exposition will draw a much bigger crowd. Figure mah picture’ll be plastered all over the internet once everything’s all said ‘n done. Doesn’t sit well with me one bit. Eenope.” </p><p>“Then why agree to it in the first place?”</p><p>Applejack twirled a strand of her hair and sighed. “Because I’d let all o’ mah friends down if Ah didn’t step up ta the plate. It’s the principle of the thing, Haki, not whether Ah enjoy bein’ gussied up n’ paraded around like a purebred sow at the county fair.”</p><p>Haki furrowed his brow in confusion. “Hold on a second. Do they really put makeup on pigs?” </p><p>“Hog breedin’ is serious business! That’s beside the point, sugarcube. What I’m sayin’ is that I’d feel much more at ease with ya by mah side. Ah know it’s outside yer comfort zone, but please consider takin’ Sandalwood’s offer. Ah can personally vouch that you’ll be adequately compensated fer yer time and effort.” </p><p>Applejack’s expression was so earnest that Haki found himself nodding in agreement. “Ok. I’ll talk to my aunt and see what her opinion on the matter is. Maybe she can give me some tips.” </p><p>The blonde farmer leaned over and kissed his cheek. “Good enough fer me.” </p><p>Applejack parked her pickup truck in front of the spa, unsure if she wanted to go through with whatever Rarity had planned for the day. Even if she’d wanted to back out of the exposition, considering that it was supposed to begin tomorrow morning, there’s no way the art club would be able to find a nude model to replace her with on such short notice. It’d taken longer than expected, but after discussing it with his aunt, Haki had reluctantly agreed to be her partner. </p><p>While Applejack waited for Rarity to show up (<i>she’d arrived twenty minutes earlier than the scheduled appointment time</i>), she pondered exactly how she would show her appreciation. A nugget of relationship advice that Granny Smith had given her granddaughters years ago came to mind: <i>Men are most content when </i><i>ya keep</i><i> their bellies full n’ their balls empty</i>. A blush formed on her freckled cheeks. Providing Haki with tasty victuals was simple enough, but she wasn’t so confident in her ability to seduce him on the spot. Regardless, Applejack firmly believed that love-making should never be conditional between partners, no matter the circumstances. </p><p>“’S not like Haki’s expectin’ a reward from me. On the other hand, I’d feel downright scummy fer rustlin’ him into this arrangement without showin’ some form o’ gratitude. Maybe Ah oughta ask Rarity fer her opinion on the matter. Assumin’, she has any decent advice ta dole out…” </p><p>The young farmer’s reverie was broken when she heard the repeated honk of a car horn. Sure enough, Rarity’s sporty little sedan with a fabulous coat of pearl squeezed into the parking spot next to Applejack’s truck. Out stepped the fashionista herself, clad in a silky black dress with a pair of matching slingbacks. All she carried with her was a white purse embroidered with a trio of diamonds. Supposedly, that was meant to be her company logo once she graduated college. </p><p>Rarity wrapped Applejack in a warm hug. “Punctual as always, I see. Shall we head inside?” </p><p>“What’s with the fancy getup, Rares? We’re goin’ ta the spa, not the Opera.” </p><p>While they headed towards the door, Rarity laughed. “I always dress in style, darling~”</p><p>“Don’t see much point in dressin’ up on account o’ the fact that we’ll be takin’ our clothes off.” </p><p>Rarity’s cheeks colored slightly after she confirmed the appointment with the receptionist. “<b>IF YOU MUST KNOW</b>—ehem—I fell behind on my laundry. This is all I had left to wear.” </p><p>“That so? Can’t say Ah empathize but Ah reckon it happens ta folks now n’ again.” </p><p>Rarity began unfastening the straps on her shoes after they’d entered the locker room. “I wouldn’t expect someone like you to understand. My apologies, darling. I didn’t mean to sound so condescending. It’s just that I’m a bit cranky today due to a lack of caffeine and… sleep.”</p><p>Applejack was already naked, since she’d only worn a t-shirt, gym shorts, and sneakers to the spa. She offered her friend a non-committal shrug. “No worries. What ya said was true. Although, I’m a might worried ‘bout yer lack o’ sleep. Is there somethin’ on yer mind, Rares?” </p><p>Even Rarity’s underwear was fancy. Black frilly things that wouldn’t have looked out of place in the pages of a high-end lingerie magazine from France. Compared to the plain fare she wore most of the time (<i>if at all</i>), Applejack had to bite back a quip, calling them expensive strips of fabric. Instead, she observed her friend’s troubled expression carefully, waiting for her to respond. </p><p>“I suppose… I’m more nervous about modeling than I’d originally anticipated. Showcasing a dress or some other article of clothing is practically second nature to me. But I won’t be wearing anything more than a layer of paint, for all intents and purposes. The thought of everyone seeing <i>Moi au natural</i> is both exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time! How do you deal with it?” </p><p>Applejack rubbed the back of her neck while Rarity slipped out of her panties. “Ta be honest, Ah don’t really give it much thought. Look—erm—just be yerself and don’t worry ‘bout what other folks think. If nothin’ else, take a swig o’ whiskey fer some added courage before ya go on.” </p><p>Rarity giggled. “I do hope you aren’t intoxicated while on the job, Applejack.” </p><p>Applejack rolled her eyes. “Not once have Ah drunk a drop while on campus!” </p><p>“Joking aside, your advice is sound. Still… I can’t help but feel anxious.”</p><p>Applejack hadn’t shared many classes with Rarity while they attended high school together, gym period being one of those included. That said, this was the first time she could ever recall seeing her friend in nude before. Rarity was, by all accounts, the very definition of a modern beauty. A petite figure with long legs, perfectly manicured nails, perky breasts, a neatly trimmed strip of violet hair nestled just below her waistline and cream-colored skin made her look almost like a porcelain doll. Applejack wasn’t exactly sure what perceived imperfection about her body that caused Rarity so much anxiety. She was drop-dead gorgeous!  </p><p>“Don’t go invitin’ trouble where there ain’t none, ya hear.” </p><p>Rarity gently closed the locker door and placed her hands on her hips. “What, pray tell, is that supposed to mean?”  </p><p>“I’m sayin’ that ya don’t have ta worry ‘bout yer figure. Yer pretty enough ta be a professional model in mah—uh—not so expert opinion. Ah know it ain’t much but that’s what Ah believe.” </p><p>Rarity smiled with a slight blush. “Thank you, darling. I appreciate the compliment.” </p><p>Feeling somewhat awkward at the momentary lapse in conversation, Applejack cleared her throat rather loudly and proceeded to gather a pair of gray bath robes to wear outside of the locker room. Rarity declined, stating that it would be pointless to get dressed as they’d need to be completely nude for the waxing session anyway. With an indifferent shrug, Applejack followed her a short distance down the hallway to where there were two padded tables set up. </p><p>The lighting was warm and muted throughout the room, creating a peaceful environment for clients. Incense sticks burned while soft classical music was being played in the background. It was similar to what Granny Smith enjoyed listening to whenever she took her afternoon nap out on the porch with Winona curled up beneath her feet. A pair of blue and pink haired twins dressed in white uniforms with the spa’s logo embroidered on the breast pocket entered the room and introduced themselves as Aloe &amp; Lotus respectively. They encouraged the two naked women to lie down flat on their backs, offering them both an additional neck pillow for comfort. </p><p>Despite the Aloe’s best efforts to make her feel relaxed, Applejack’s muscles tensed up when she laid down on the table. A pang of unease gurgled in the pit of her stomach. “So—um—this is mah first time gettin’ a Brazilian wax. Not sure what I’m supposed ta do…” </p><p>Aloe smiled while she heated up a small plastic container full of green goo. “There’s no need to worry, Miss Applejack. We’ve performed this procedure countless times. First, I shall apply a coating of special cream. This softens the hair follicles and will ensure that the waxing is as pain-free as possible. There may be some discomfort at times, but I promise to be as gentle as possible.”</p><p>Hesitantly, Applejack spread her legs further apart to give Aloe better access to her crotch. “Under normal circumstances, I prefer ta have plenty o’ hair coverin’ mah coochie. This here is a special occasion. Need it nice n’ smooth on account o’ the up-comin’ art exposition at CU.” </p><p>“Ah~ I heard about that. Body painting is certainly an interesting art form.” </p><p>Applejack shivered when the cold cream was slathered onto her privates. She nearly jumped off the table when Aloe began spreading the cream around the outside edge of her anus as well. “<b>WHAT IN TARNATION ARE YA DOIN’ AROUND </b><b>MAH</b><b> BUTTHOLE?!!” </b> </p><p>Aloe blinked in confusion. “Miss Rarity paid for the full treatment. That includes your backside. Please don’t feel embarrassed, Miss Applejack. It is a difficult area for one to wax on their own.” </p><p>Cheeks flushed, Applejack laid down on the table once more and glared at Rarity. “Fer Pete’s sake. Ah oughta slug ya in the snoot fer not mentionin’ that particular detail.” </p><p>Rarity waved her hand nonchalantly. “There’s no need to get testy, darling. We might as well tidy up everywhere, seeing as how we may be asked to take compromising positions while modeling. Besides, when was the last time you had a decent trimming down there, hmm?” </p><p>Applejack let out an angry growl. “Ah ain’t some hairy gorilla; Ah shave regularly, ya know.” </p><p>“I never implied that you were. Smooth is sexy, darling. Trust me; Haki will like it.”</p><p>Applejack bit her lip. “Ya really think so? Even as a born naturist, Ah don’t want folks payin’ particular attention ta that part o’ mah body. Uh… we haven’t done much experimentin’ o’ the carnal nature if ya catch mah drift. Does that sort o’ thing—erm—feel good in rear end too?”   </p><p>“Hmm. To some people it can. You’d best discuss the matter with Haki first.” </p><p>Applejack curled her toes while the hot wax was applied. “A sound idea.” </p><p>No warning was given when the hardened layer of wax was peeled off. Like Aloe had warned, it did cause Applejack a little bit of discomfort, but nothing she hadn’t experienced before. She actually chuckled, reminiscing about the time she’d rescued Winona from a briar patch after the dog had chased a gopher clear across the breadth of Sweet Apple Acres. From head to toe, the blonde naturist had been covered in little cuts and scrapes, prompting Big Mac to give her an impromptu bath with a washcloth soaked in antiseptic. He’d been gentle about that too, but it still stung like the dickens. </p><p>Not only did Applejack teach Winona never to go into a briar patch again (<i>the young puppy had learned her lesson after being denied her favorite treats for a month</i>), she recounted the cautionary tale to Apple Bloom in order to ensure that her little sister wouldn’t make the same mistake as she had that fateful summer. Much to Applejack’s chagrin, Granny Smith had also taken a picture of her grumpy, preteen granddaughter shortly after the incident, claiming that it was a memory the whole family should cherish for generations to come. </p><p>She’d reminisced a while longer than anticipated, feeling a slight tinge of embarrassment when Aloe asked her if everything was alright. Without even realizing it, Applejack’s waxing session had already reached its conclusion. Somehow, she expected her privates to be a little sore but, surprisingly, she felt little to no discomfort whatsoever. </p><p>Aloe encouraged her to get up off of the table and inspect her body in front of a large mirror to make sure she was satisfied with the procedure. Even after taking a few steps forward, Applejack immediately noticed how breezy it felt in-between her legs. Sure enough, when she gazed in the mirror, her mons was smoother than a baby’s behind. Applejack shivered for a moment, then a rosy blush crept onto her cheeks as she realized how immature it made her look. </p><p>Rarity followed suit and let out a hum of satisfaction while she watched her own reflection in the mirror. “A splendid job as always, Lotus. What’s wrong, Applejack? You look upset.” </p><p>The blonde naturist fought the urge to cover up her privates. Instead, she rubbed her arm. “Are ya sure this was the right decision? Ah feel… nekkid without any hair ta cover up mah coochie.” </p><p>Rarity placed her hand on Applejack’s shoulder. “You look fabulous, darling. And, dare I say, you’ll be even more fabulous once all of the paint is applied. Take pride in your appearance, Applejack. With a physique like that, no one can possibly deny your womanly charm.”</p><p>Applejack shuffled her feet. “If ya say so…” </p><p>“Just remember, hair eventually grows back. Far faster than I care for, but the point remains.”</p><p>Applejack began walking towards the locker room with Rarity following close behind. While she slipped into her gym shorts and t-shirt, her phone vibrated briefly, showing that Haki had sent her a text. She smiled when a picture of a cartoon dog showed up on the screen saying “<i>Good Luck</i>”. After searching for an equally cartoonish zebra, Applejack sent the text back, giggling. </p><p>“A word of advice, darling. You should masturbate right before the session tomorrow.”</p><p>Applejack nearly choked on her own spit. “Why the hell would Ah do that fer?” </p><p>“To avoid any awkward situations where one might become aroused on stage. I realize that you’re accustomed to being nude most of the time, but having your body painted is a unique and—how shall we say—stimulating experience. A lady must be prepared for such things.”</p><p>Applejack shook her head. “Remains ta be seen.”</p><p>“It’s merely a suggestion. I know that I feel much more relaxed after a good orgasm.”</p><p>Ignoring her friend’s comment, Applejack decided to change the topic. “How early do ya reckon we’ll have ta show up fer prep? Ah imagine it’ll take a while ta git set up fer the exposition.”</p><p>“Indeed. From what I understand, Sandalwood mentioned that we wouldn’t be ready to ‘<i>go on stage</i>’ until tomorrow afternoon. I’ll text you and let you know as soon as I am aware.” </p><p>Applejack sighed in frustration. “Alright. I’ll git up early tomorrow mornin’ just in case.” </p><p>“Pardon my ignorance, but isn’t it normal for farmers to—erm—rise with the chickens?” </p><p>Applejack nodded while she put on her shoes. “Eeyup. How else do ya think we can git all the chores done by the evenin’? Runnin’ a farm is hard work, but rewardin’ all the same.” </p><p>“I’ve no doubt that it is, darling. However, I can’t see myself getting involved with the agricultural scene anytime soon. To each their own, as it were.” </p><p>Applejack shrugged. “Doesn’t bother me none. We’ve all got our own unique talents.” </p><p>After exchanging a warm embrace, the two women exited the spa and went their respective ways. While driving the family truck down the road towards Sweet Apple Acres, Applejack’s mind began to wander. She gripped the steering wheel while she pondered and couldn’t quite shake the nervous roiling that churned deep within the pit of her stomach. Thankfully, when she pulled into the barn, Winona was there to greet her, tail wagging happily as she received love and attention from her mistress. Applejack ruffled Winona’s ears and sighed. </p><p>“I’m still on the fence ‘bout tomorrow, girl. Maybe I’m just overthinkin’ things. A tasty supper n’ a full night’s rest oughta clear mah mind. Or—um—Ah suppose Ah could also do what Rarity suggested. Who knows? We’ll cross that bridge when we git there.” </p><hr/><p>Applejack slept about as well as could be expected and rose before the sun crept over the horizon. She went on to complete her typical morning routine of taking a quick shower, brewing a pot of coffee, and eating breakfast. It was relatively light for a farmer, only consisting of a bacon, egg, and cheese omelet, some applesauce, and two slices of buttered toast. She consumed it with her usual efficiency and gulped down two cups of joe. When it was all said and done, she looked over at the clock and realized that it was just about fifteen minutes past six. The rest of the family would be waking up soon, so she quietly went back upstairs to her bedroom.</p><p>The blonde nudist laid back on her bed, looking up at the ceiling, wiggling her toes in nervous anticipation. Thus far, her phone had remained silent. Rarity had yet to send her a text. To be fair, it was still quite early in the morning. There was a distinct possibility that she might not even be called in until eight or even nine o’clock to start the prep-work. Full of energy with nowhere to go, Applejack hopped to her feet and began to pace around the room. </p><p>Rarity’s advice from earlier echoed in her mind. Applejack paused for a moment and looked at the lowermost drawer of her dresser and gulped. She crouched on her haunches and slid it open, revealing a nondescript cardboard box pushed to the very back. She took it out gingerly and removed the lid, revealing a thick, eighteen-centimeter-long dildo, tawny brown in color, that resembled a tree trunk. It’d been somewhat of a gag gift from Granny on her sixteenth birthday. </p><p>Or so Granny claimed. The silicone sex toy was obviously custom ordered and of high quality. Out of sheer embarrassment, Applejack had relegated it to the back of the drawer, and never spoke of it again. In fact, she’d never used it before, as evidenced by the original packaging. After a quick inspection, Applejack realized that it even had a vibrate function. She happened to have some Double-A batteries in her room, so she popped them in and tested them out, making her eyes widen in surprise when the dildo began to vibrate in her hand. Blushing, she turned it off. </p><p>“Tarnation. Am Ah really gonna do this?” Applejack whispered to herself. </p><p>She padded into the bathroom and grabbed a small container of Vaseline that she used to keep her skin moisturized, but knew full-well would provide adequate lubrication. For a moment, she considered hiding everything under her hat. However, the dildo proved to be too unwieldy, so she chose to put everything in her trusty rucksack instead. </p><p>With the grace and dexterity of a naked ninja, she crept down the stairs, trying to avoid any members of her family who had woken up. Predictably, Big Mac was in the kitchen, cooking breakfast while Apple Bloom sat at the table, drinking a mug of coffee. The very last stair, known for being squeaky, gave Applejack’s position away. The two siblings looked over and greeted their sister. </p><p>“Howdy y’all. Makin’ breakfast?” </p><p>Mac nodded. “Eeyep. Today’s the big day, huh?” </p><p>“Yeah. Ain’t sure when I’m supposed ta head over though.” </p><p>“Nervous?” </p><p>“A little.” Applejack replied. </p><p>Apple Bloom cocked her head. “Headed out somewhere?” </p><p>“Figure Ah might go out fer a walk, maybe swim, just ta clear mah head.” </p><p>Apple Bloom shrugged. “Fair Enough. We’ll be here when ya git back. Should Ah brew more coffee?” </p><p>“Nah. I’ve already had two cups. Don’t wanna git all jittery before mah performance.” </p><p>“Make sure ya keep hydrated though. I’m sure the organizers won’t mind if ya need ta take a potty break every now n’ then.” </p><p>Applejack smiled. “Reckon that’s some solid advice, sugarcube.”</p><p>“Do ya want Winona ta tag along? She’s always up fer a swim.”</p><p>“<b>NO</b>. Ah—mean—it’s fine. She can stay here. Prefer ta do this on mah own.” Applejack blurted.</p><p>Apple Bloom stretched out her arms above her head and groaned as she felt a pleasant popping sensation. “Might take a swim mahself later on. Seems like a good day fer it. Oh, and good luck with the exhibition today.”</p><p>“Thanks. Appreciate it.” </p><p>Surprised that no one had commented on the lack of hair covering her privates, Applejack took her leave and journeyed deep into the orchard where she hoped to gain a bit of privacy. Despite the early hour, it was pleasantly warm outside, with a steady breeze blowing in from the west. When Applejack looked around one more time to make sure there was no one else around, she sat down in the grass underneath an old apple tree they’d affectionately named Bloomberg. </p><p>She coated the shaft of the dildo with Vaseline and stared at it for a moment. “Whowee! This thing is a helluva lot thicker than Ah realized. Hope it ain’t too difficult fer me ta handle.” </p><p>Feeling very much out of her element, Applejack spread her legs apart slightly and teased the edge of her lips with the tip of the dildo. Without any hair to get in the way, it made her more sensitive than usual, sending a tingling jolt of electric pleasure through her stomach. She reached down and began to play with her clit, stroking it a few times to help get her more in the mood.</p><p>When her womanhood started to become wet, she began sliding the dildo in a little bit at a time, in order to get used to its girth. Applejack grunted slightly at the sensation of being filled to the brim. The toy was significantly thicker than Haki’s penis, after all. And so, she grabbed hold of the base and began sliding the dildo inside and out, in a slow, rhythmic motion. At first, she was mortified at the lewd suckling sounds it made, but as time went on, her embarrassment faded as pleasure replaced it. Moments later, she came all over the grass after a brief moan of ecstasy. </p><p>“Glad Ah decided ta do this outside. Would’ve made a big ole mess otherwise.” </p><p>The first orgasm had certainly felt good and released some of the tension she’d held back over the past few days, but Applejack wasn’t satisfied with stopping there. She reasoned that if she’d gone to the trouble of going all the way out here and bringing the proper equipment along, it’d be a waste not to take advantage of the situation. Without the slightest hesitation, she raised her rump in the air and inserted the dildo once more. This time, she turned on the vibrator function. </p><p>It was like night and day. The vibration made it feel so much better. Throwing caution to the wind, Applejack moaned loudly as another orgasm began to build within her. After cumming two more times, the farmgirl’s lust was satiated as she laid back in the grass, staring up at the orange-yellow sky of sunrise. She lazily rolled over and checked her phone. Much to her surprise, only an hour had passed from the time she’d left the house. </p><p>Applejack’s heart dropped when she heard barking. In the distance, she spotted her little sister, hair still wet from swimming in the pond, approaching with Winona in tow. There wasn’t enough time to hide the dildo, and even if she did, it bothered her that the toy needed to be cleaned first before being placed back inside the rucksack. Applejack didn’t need a mirror to know that she looked and smelled like a sweaty mess. With a resigned sigh, she sat up. </p><p>“How was yer—um—walk, Applejack?” </p><p>“There’s no need ta beat around the bush, Apple Bloom. It’s plain as day what Ah was doin’.” </p><p>Apple Bloom coughed. “Oh… well, just so ya know, there ain’t nothin’ wrong with masturbatin’. Perfectly healthy thing fer us gals ta do. Even helps me relax on occasion.” </p><p>“Fer Pete’s sake! I’m an adult. If anythin’, Ah should be havin’ this talk with ya instead.” </p><p>Apple Bloom chuckled. “Granny beat ya ta it by a longshot.” </p><p>Blushing, Applejack crossed her arms underneath her breasts. “Yeah, Ah remember. Look—erm—can we just forget this conversation ever happened? I’d rather focus on psyching mahself up fer the exhibition. Although, Ah do have ta admit, Ah feel more relaxed now…” </p><p>Apple Bloom nodded emphatically. “Couple o’ orgasms’ll do that.” </p><p>Applejack stood up, brushed off the grass from her bottom, and placed her hands on her hips. “Ah suspect Rarity’s gonna text me any minute now. Oughta take another shower before Ah go.” </p><p>“Ah promise I’ll swing by the college later on and see the exhibition. Might bring Sweetie, Scoots, n’ Babs if they’re up fer it. Unless… yer bothered by us bein’ there.” </p><p>Applejack smiled and ruffled her little sister’s hair. “Y’all are more than welcome ta stop on by. I’m just nervous ‘bout bein’ the center o’ attention. Modelin’ on mah own ain’t the same thing. With that, it’s more—how do Ah put it—business like. Sorry. It’s difficult fer me ta explain.”</p><p>Apple Bloom tapped her chin in thought. “Ah think Ah understand where yer comin’ from. Anywho, I’ll let ya git cleaned up before ya go. Good luck, sis.”</p><p>Like clockwork, Applejack’s phone began to vibrate just as she started toweling off. Thankfully, her little session in the orchard, combined with a hot shower had done wonders to help settle her frazzled nerves, but there was still a hint of lingering anxiety deep in the pit of her stomach. She let the feeling pass after taking in a deep breath through her nose and answered the call. </p><p>“Good morning! I hope you’re ready for today!” </p><p>After applying deodorant to her armpits, Applejack clicked her tongue. “Ready as I’ll ever be.” </p><p>“I’m curious. Did you follow my advice?” </p><p>Applejack grimaced. “Not that it’s any o’ yer business, but Ah did.” </p><p>“Good. I imagine you feel so much better now hmm?” Rarity mused. </p><p>“Can’t argue with that.”</p><p>Rarity tittered. “These are modern times, darling. Modern women have nothing to be ashamed of whilst pleasuring themselves. I had a rather intense self-love session myself this morning to help calm my nerves. In any case, I shall be over in approximately twenty minutes to pick you up.”</p><p>“Alright. Sounds good. Do ya want any breakfast ta go? Ah got plenty o’ food here ta share.” </p><p>“While I appreciate the offer, I’d rather not model on a full stomach. Especially if it’s heavy farm fare. Oh! Please don’t be offended, darling. I’m sure you’re an accomplished cook.”</p><p>Applejack shrugged. “Yer loss. Ah just don’t wanna hear ya bitchin’ ‘bout bein’ hungry.” </p><p>“I’m sure the staff will provide us with a catered lunch.”</p><p>Applejack slipped into a sundress and sneakers. “Ah don’t remember that bein’ part o’ the deal, but maybe we can convince Sandalwood ta rustle up some grub fer us later on.”</p><p>“I’m hanging up now. See you soon, dear.”</p>
