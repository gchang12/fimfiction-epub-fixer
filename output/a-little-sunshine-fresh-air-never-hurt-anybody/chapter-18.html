		<h1>Body Paint Exposition</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 18</b></p><p>Art Department Building, Canterlot University  </p><p>Applejack arrived on scene, early bird as usual, and took a moment to steady her nerves. While she’d done plenty of nude modeling in front of small groups of people before, body painting was a brand-new experience for the young woman. One that she had no expectations going in, no preconceived notions as to what exactly was involved (<i>beyond waxing her pubic hair</i>) as it had not been a topic of interest prior to the day of Fluttershy’s proposal. Minutes passed as she impatiently paced back and forth in the staging room, waiting for the others to arrive. </p><p>Three of the participants carpooled together because it was more efficient. Fluttershy was already staying with Rarity and Sandalwood didn’t live far away from campus. Haki showed up a few minutes afterward, giving his girlfriend a quick kiss after they hugged. Without further ado, Sandalwood clapped his hands together and asked everyone to gather round, so that he could explain how the body painting process would work and who was being paired up with whom. </p><p>“Like I mentioned before during our initial meeting, Haki &amp; AJ will be one couple while Rarity and I will stand in as the other. It’s meant to reflect male and female pairs found in the animal kingdom. I will be painted in the likeness of a Grey Wolf, Rarity will be a White Tiger, Applejack will be a Fox, and Haki will be a Lion. Canid and Feline opposites.”</p><p>Applejack raised her hand. “How long is this supposed ta take, ya reckon?” </p><p>“Quite a while, I’m afraid. Painting every nook and cranny of a person’s body is an intricate process. Not to worry; we’ll have plenty of time for breaks and refreshments prior to the expo.”</p><p>Fluttershy cleared her throat. “I’ll be painting the girls while Tree Hugger will take care of the boys. I hope everyone doesn’t mind the lack of privacy. We figured that it would be a lot more efficient to keep our supplies in one central location. And—um—you’ll all be naked around each other for a while anyway so…” </p><p>Rarity chortled. “We’re all aware of what we signed up for darling. Shall we begin?” </p><p>“Oh! Um—if the two of you don’t mind, please remove your clothing.” </p><p>Applejack let out a nervous chuckle. “Shucks. Ya don’t have ta tell me twice!”</p><p>After taking off her sneakers, Applejack lifted the sundress she was wearing over her head and sighed. The room had always been airconditioned for everyone’s comfort, but somehow, it felt noticeably chillier today than when she’d modeled for the art club. Applejack absentmindedly reached down to scratch her crotch out of habit and realized why. Thinking back to their spa date, the blonde tomboy fidgeted in place, scrunched her toes, and tried to remain calm. </p><p>“Sorry if Ah seem a might jittery, y’all. Still ain’t accustomed ta bein’ a full-on smoothie.” </p><p>Rarity arched her brow. “Does a lack of hair between your legs really make that much of a difference? With the way you’re acting right now, you’d think the world was ending. My goodness, Applejack. You’re being more of a drama queen than I am! And I should know!”</p><p>Face flushed pink from both anger and embarrassment, Applejack glared at her friend. “Ah ain’t bein’ a drama queen! This here is… an unusual situation fer a gal like me. A fish outta water moment. Don’cha worry none, Rares. I’m committed. It’ll just take me a spell ta adjust.”</p><p>Haki had just slipped out of his briefs when he looked over at his girlfriend. “Wow, I didn’t know you had freckles down there too. Hey—uh—it’s not a bad thing! They’re cute.”</p><p>Applejack placed her hands on her hips, narrowing her eyes at Haki. “Don’t let yer gaze wander too much, buckaroo. We’re on the clock, remember? Got ourselves a job ta do this afternoon. Best ta act professional fer the sake o’ everyone involved.” </p><p>Eager to mollify Applejack’s ire, Haki decided that silence was the best answer. He nodded in agreement and waited patiently for Tree Hugger to get her palette prepared. Subconsciously, Haki cupped his hands over his genitals and rocked back and forth on the balls of his feet, not at all comfortable with the idea of letting it all hang out in a room full of people he barely knew. </p><p>Haki cleared his throat, peering over Tree Hugger’s shoulder while she mixed colors. He swallowed hard because the hippie wore a thin, green tank top that barely contained her voluminous breasts, a pair of loose-fitting gym shorts, and sandals. It was obvious to anyone in the room that she wasn’t wearing a bra underneath her top. Haki felt a stirring of excitement in his loins, but clamped down on it by taking in a deep breath through his nose, blowing it through his lips, and counting to twenty in his mind. </p><p>Oblivious to Haki’s discomfort, Tree Hugger turned around and smiled. “Chillax, dude. No need to be so uptight. I’m as professional as professional can be~ Now, I know you’re a newbie at this whole body canvas shindig but I think it’s best if we get you painted up first. Ya dig?” </p><p>“I guess so. Mind my asking but does <i>EVERYTHING</i> need to be painted?” </p><p>Tree Hugger nodded empathically. “Duh. It’d look weird otherwise. Keep up the positive vibes, Haki. I’ve seen plenty of bodacious baby-batter bazookas before. They come in all shapes and sizes, my dude. Some are cute n’ tiny like those mini hot dogs wrapped in crescent rolls. Man… a plate full of those would be soooooo good right now. I’ve got a serious case of the munchies.”</p><p>“Are you high right now?” Haki asked hesitantly. </p><p>The hippie giggled. “I didn’t puff on a fat doobie before coming here if that’s what you mean. Shy said that was a no-go. So, I popped a few gummies instead. No stink, no problem! Helps me with the creative process. Aligns the chakras. The colors are more vibrant, man.” </p><p>“Ok then… where do we start?” </p><p>Tree Hugger tapped her chin in thought. “Hmm. The face is always the hardest part. Takes the most time. Lots of details. No worries, dude. You can sit down and get comfy. Feel the breeze between your knees~ Just let me know when you need a potty break or a snack.”</p><p>Haki sat down on one of several plush recliners throughout the room, thankful that he had somewhere comfortable to be seated where his skin wouldn’t stick to the surface. He spread his legs apart only slightly and placed his hands on the arm rests. The feeling of awkward tension stubbornly refused to leave as Tree Hugger went to work. Haki’s stomach roiled with nervous energy while his mouth became dry. He was tempted to close his eyes altogether just to avoid gawking at Tree Hugger’s jiggling breasts that were practically shoved in front of his face.  </p><p>“Uh—it’s a bit chilly in here today, huh?” </p><p>Tree hugger shrugged, unaware that her nipples had become erect and were poking through the thin fabric of her tank top. “Better than being hot n’ sweaty all day. Nobody likes getting swamp ass. Ball soup as well in your case. Hehe~ That’d be a real drag, man. The body paint we’re using for the expo is designed to be waterproof, ya know. Won’t come off unless you use a special type of soap. The brainiacs who designed this stuff sure knew what they were doing.”</p><p>“For sure. I-I’ll be quiet now, so you can concentrate on painting.” </p><p>Tree Hugger waved her hand. “I’m cool with small talk, dude. You need to relax or you’ll wind up getting some serious muscle cramps. Those’ll throw off your vibes any day. Are you worried about shrinkage? Doesn’t look like your little buddy’s gotten much smaller to me. Even if he did, I’d totally understand. It’s—like—natural, given the circumstances.” </p><p>“I’d appreciate it if you wouldn’t stare at my junk.” </p><p>Tree Hugger stuck her tongue out while she concentrated on painting Haki’s forehead. “Stare? Nah, bro. I prefer me some buxom <i>chicas </i>most of the time, but I’ve been known to take up the bat when the mood strikes. Besides, you can’t miss what’s dangling right there in front of you.”</p><p>Her breasts happened to jiggle again as she said it, causing Haki to roll his eyes. “Dangling in plain sight. Sure. Sorry if I’ve been a jerk to you, Tree Hugger. It’s not intentional. I just—body painting isn’t exactly within my comfort zone. The main reason I’m here is to support AJ.” </p><p>The hippie smiled. “Aww that’s sweet.”</p><p>Haki found himself blushing, even though it wasn’t obvious due to his dark skin. “Sandalwood mentioned that I was going to be painted like a lion. Look, I might not be an artist, but aren’t loins supposed to be a lighter brown color? What you’ve got there is almost chocolate.” </p><p>“Normally, yeah. Darker tones compliment your skin pigment better. That’s also why we’re going with a black mane instead of a tawny one. Plus, you’ll have an awesome contrast with AJ.” </p><p>“Contrast,” Haki inquired, “I thought she was supposed to be a fox. Aren’t they reddish orange?” </p><p>Tree Hugger snickered. “Don’t you know anything about animals, dude? Foxes can have blonde fur too. Setting her up with any other coloration would be—like—a crime against art!” </p><p>“Oh! Well—erm—yeah, I can see why you’d pick that color scheme. Good choice.” </p><p>The artist sighed while twirling the end of one of her dreadlocks. “To be honest, I’m kinda jealous of Applejack. She’s got such smooth, glossy hair like cornsilk or something. C’mon, man. Just between you and me: does she taste like apples down there?” </p><p>“I beg your pardon?”</p><p>Tree Hugger pointed towards her crotch. “AJ’s pussy. Does it taste like apples? There’re all kinds of studies online that say if people eat a shit-ton of fruit, like pineapple, it makes their cum taste sweet. Mine doesn’t taste much like anything, so I’ve been told. Then again, I don’t like pineapple very much to begin with. Have you ever tried that trick out yourself, Haki?” </p><p>Haki coughed awkwardly. “Tree Hugger, I don’t mean to be rude but that’s a little too personal of a question for me. Can we—maybe—move on to a different topic, please?”</p><p>“Sorry! Didn’t mean to pry, my dude. Curiosity gets the better of me sometimes.” </p><p>Haki gripped the armrests out of sheer frustration, his fingertips turning white, trying his best not to get upset with a woman who clearly had no concept of personal boundaries. “Fair enough. Let’s try to keep the conversation PG from here on out. Hmm… hobbies! That’s a safe enough subject. What do you enjoy doing in your spare time, Tree Hugger? I enjoy swimming myself.”</p><p>“I practice yoga. Helps keep me nice and limber~ If you want, I’d be more than happy to give you a little demonstration later on. Dude, you wouldn’t believe how much the positions can—”</p><p>Haki held up his hand to stop the hippie from speaking any further. “No, I don’t want to imagine all the crazy ways people can fuck by using yoga techniques. That’s what you were just about to say, wasn’t it? Ugh! Are you even capable of having a normal conversation?”</p><p>“Far out! It’s like you read my mind!” </p><p>Haki let out a deep sigh. “We’ll stick to business then.” </p><hr/><p>Meanwhile, the girls were having a splendid time chatting with Fluttershy while she painted their bodies. Rarity’s design was relatively simple, black &amp; white tiger stripes, so her “<i>costume</i>” was finished before everyone else’s save for a few extra accessories. The fashionista took her leave and said that she was off to gather the remaining supplies they’d need to complete their costumes and to take a quick break for coffee and, of course, to freshen up. While she padded towards the restrooms, Rarity was relieved that their body paint was designed to be waterproof. She didn’t need to worry about it accidentally rubbing off from sweat, a spilled drink, or other liquids that weren’t polite to mention during casual conversation. </p><p>Applejack’s design, on the other hand, was more intricate and required a greater amount of detail to simulate blonde fur. Fluttershy purposely copied the exact shade of her hair, so that it would appear as a seamless transition rather than just paint. While Applejack could appreciate fine craftsmanship under the current circumstances, it did little to put her impatient nature to rest. </p><p>Worse yet, she had to stand slightly bow-legged in order to make it easier for Fluttershy to access her privates. The sensation wasn’t unpleasant, per say, but it did tickle a bit given that she wasn’t used to that particular place being balder than a baby’s bottom. Applejack was having difficulty striking up a conversation with the person who was practically shoving their face in her crotch. </p><p>“I’m almost finished.” Fluttershy advised. </p><p>Applejack clasped her hands behind her back and looked up at the ceiling. “Take yer time, sugarcube. Ah ain’t goin’ nowhere. Might as well make it look neat n’ pretty fer everyone.” </p><p>Fluttershy stood up and smiled. “All done~ I think you’ll be pleased with the results. You can go take a look in the mirror now… um—you know, to make sure nothing needs to be touched up.” </p><p>“Hells bells. Would ya look at that,” Applejack exclaimed while checking out her body in front of the mirror, “a darn near spittin’ image of a fox. Heh. Save fer all mah human parts, that is.” </p><p>Fluttershy blushed at the praise. “I’m glad you think so.”</p><p>Rarity entered the room once more, carrying a bag with her. “I’m back, darlings~”</p><p>“What’cha got there in the bag, Rares?” </p><p>With a shit-eating grin, Rarity pulled out a few accessories. “What we need to complete our ensemble, of course! Everything you see here was custom ordered, specifically for the exposition. First of which are silicone ear tips that adhere to skin at or slightly below body temperature, and come off when anything cold is applied. Ingenious wouldn’t you say?” </p><p>“Nifty little things. Uh… are those supposed ta be our tails?” </p><p>Rarity held up a white tiger tail. It was exactly what Applejack would have expected, save for the bulb-shaped object attached to the end. She blanched at the implication. “Indeed, they are!”</p><p>“Gee, Rares. Ah dunno what to make of ‘em. They sure do look like animal tails. Mind mah askin’ but why do they got them bulbs at the end? Did Ah miss the memo or somethin’?” </p><p>“It’s quite simple really,” Rarity assured, “they’re modified anal plugs. We want to make our appearance as seamless as possible, so this is the ideal solution. I have one for you as well.” </p><p>Applejack’s face flushed a deep shade of crimson. “Now, hold on just a damned minute! Ah didn’t agree ta shove some kinky cosplay sex toy up mah poop chute. Even if it’s fer the sake o’ makin’ us look like the critters we’re painted up ta be. Can’t we just tape ‘em on instead?” </p><p>Rarity let out a dramatic sigh, placing her hand over her forehead. “I’m afraid not, dear. These are the only accessories we have on hand currently. One must make sacrifices for art! Think of those poor animals, Applejack. Do it for their sake, if not for <i>avant-garde</i> artistic expression.” </p><p>Overhearing Rarity’s proposal, Fluttershy fidgeted in place while blushing. “Oh my! You two are very brave for doing such a thing. I-I don’t think I’d have the courage to show off an accessory like that in front of a room full of complete strangers. They’d see <i>EVERYTHING</i>…” </p><p>Completely nonplussed, Applejack’s shoulders sagged in defeat as she looked at the blonde fox tail in Rarity’s hand. “Assumin’ Ah agree ta such a ridiculous notion, how do we go ‘bout gettin’ ‘em… situated properly, if ya catch mah drift. Land’s sake. Ah can’t believe Ah said that…”</p><p>Rarity reached into her bag and pulled out a small container full of Vaseline. “With a healthy application of lubricant, of course! A lady must always come prepared as I’m sure you know.”</p><p>Applejack frowned. “Scares me ta no end that ya put so much thought into it, Rares.” </p><p>“My dear, sweet Applejack, I can’t very well be involved in this project without accounting for all the little details others might very well miss. I’d be doing a disservice to everyone if I neglected to do so. Now, if you don’t mind, I need someone to rub Vaseline around the area of insertion. Be sure to coat the plug thoroughly too! We want them to slide in like butter.”</p><p>Applejack watched as her friend bent over and spread her cheeks apart without a shred of hesitation or shame, revealing the puckered pink surprise in the middle. Tiger tail in hand, the farmer hesitantly dipped her fingers into the container and scooped out a sizable blob of petroleum jelly and proceeded to coat the end of the bulb like the fashionista suggested. She heaved a heavy sigh after scooping out another glob and took a closer look at Rarity’s backside. </p><p>“This is all sorts o’ weird. Ah don’t—this ain’t right!” </p><p>Rarity looked over her shoulder and huffed. “I assure you that my rear end has been thoroughly cleaned. I made sure of it this morning. Please be gentle with me, Applejack. I’m—erm—rather sensitive back there, as it were. When it’s your turn, I’ll be sure to extend the same courtesy.” </p><p>“Ah knew it! Yer doin’ this ta git yer jollies in before the show!” Applejack growled. </p><p>Taken aback, Rarity cleared her throat. “I will admit that I enjoy pleasuring myself back there when the mood strikes. However, this is an entirely different situation. It’s our responsibility to look as authentic as possible for the guests. We need to raise a substantial amount of money today and this is the best way to achieve that goal. Tell me I’m wrong, Applejack. I dare you!” </p><p>Applejack clenched her jaw and grumbled. “Fine. Just don’t make a fuss ‘bout it.”</p><p>“Darling, you know I can’t possibly make a promise to—OH HELLOooooaaaahngh. Goodness me! What nimble fingers you have, Applejack~ Did you make sure to—mmmmm yesssss that’s the ticket. I’m quite confident the inside of my starfish is coated properly.”</p><p>Blushing profusely all the way down to the tips of her breasts, Applejack took hold of the tail and began to press it against Rarity’s glossy butthole, making sure the bulbed end fit snugly. Much to her horror, the whole thing got swallowed up in the blink of an eye, causing Rarity to let out a protracted, lewd moan that drew everyone’s undivided attention to what they were doing. To make matters worse, Applejack spotted a clear, viscous liquid that definitely wasn’t water slowly creep down Rarity’s leg while her entire body quivered like a bowl full of fruit gelatin.  </p><p>For the first time all day, Rarity seemed genuinely embarrassed. Or maybe the redness coloring her cheeks was simply due to her heightened state of arousal. Whatever the reason, she excused herself for a moment and awkwardly waddled towards the restroom at full speed while cupping her hand over her crotch. Applejack seethed with anger and shame. This was too much. </p><p>“Git back ta what y’all were doin’! Ain’t nothin’ ta see here.” </p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, the pale-skinned dress designer walked back into the room with a contented swagger and a wide grin. “How refreshing! I feel so much better now. Applejack, darling, are you ready to have your tail inserted? I promise it won’t hurt.” </p><p>Applejack twirled a strand of her hair and bit her lip. “Pain ain’t exactly mah primary concern at the moment. Dang it, Rarity. Did ya have ta go and make such a commotion?”</p><p>Rarity chortled nervously. “Erm—well—that wasn’t on purpose. I couldn’t help it! The plug filled me up so suddenly, I didn’t know how else to react. It felt marvelous, darling.” </p><p>“Yeah. Ah noticed how ya were leakin’ like a rusty faucet.” Applejack intoned; brow raised. </p><p>Rarity leaned over to whisper in her ear. “Not to worry; I took care of that little problem while I was in the restroom. Nothing quite like a spine-tingling orgasm to steady one’s nerves, eh?” </p><p>“Enough o’ that nonsense. Let’s git this over with before Ah lose mah <i>NERVE</i>.”</p><hr/><p>It had become increasingly difficult to remain focused on the task at hand with all of the commotion being created by the exposition’s female duo who were just a few steps away across the room. Haki had only caught snippets of their conversation, but it was more than enough to pique his curiosity. In particular, when it came to his freckled beau and what she was about to do with a rather scandalous piece of cosplay kit. The fox tail itself looked authentic and complemented her body paint perfectly, as did the ear tips that Rarity had provided.  </p><p>Yet, he couldn’t get over the flesh-colored silicone bulb attached to the end. Was Applejack really going to stick that thing up her rear-end for the entire exposition? Recalling their time together at the resort, Haki knew that Applejack tended to be conservative when it came to matters of the bedroom, and had not been too keen on the idea of having anal sex of any sort. </p><p>Haki admitted to himself that he wasn’t particularly fond of anal play either, but Applejack had a spectacularly sculpted <i>gluteus maximus</i> that could put marble statues to shame. To be fair, the rest of her tan-colored skin teemed with toned muscle, an obvious indication of a life spent working on the farm. A trait that only served to enhance her rustic, country-girl charm.</p><p>Tree Hugger remained seated while Haki stood with his hands at his sides, fixing his gaze on the pair of women carrying on before him. Currently, the hippie was at eye level with his penis, busy applying paint to the area immediately around the pubis. She’d not yet begun to paint his member proper, as by her admission, it was a difficult body part to color correctly. </p><p>“Head’s up, dude. I’m gonna start painting your dick now.” </p><p>Haki blinked, shaken from his reverie. “Alright. I’m as ready as I’ll ever be.”</p><p>“I’ll have to hold it up just so you know. Unless, you’d prefer to do that yourself.” </p><p>Haki shuffled his feet. “Do whatever is necessary. I—uh—apologize in advance if I get excited.”</p><p>Tree Hugger chuckled. “Doesn’t faze me. Nothing but a natural process, man.” </p><p>The sensation of the cool brush tip tickling his shaft while Tree Hugger held up his penis by the tip of the head in-between her fingers was not as stimulating as Haki imagined it would be. It felt odd, but not entirely unpleasant. Not that he was complaining. In no time at all, she finished and moved onto his balls, cupping them slightly at times to make sure they were coated evenly. It was at this point, he overheard Applejack say that she was ready to have the tail put in. </p><p>Applejack braced herself against a chair, legs spread apart and bent over so that Rarity could have easy access to her backside. With the container full of Vaseline in hand, the nude fashionista crouched on her haunches and ran her other hand across Applejack’s firm, freckled butt cheeks giving them a squeeze for good measure. Giggling like a schoolgirl, Rarity applied a glob of petroleum jelly to her fingertips.</p><p>“Damn it, Rares! That’s downright unprofessional. Quit foolin’ ‘round back there!” </p><p>“My apologies, darling. I simply couldn’t resist giving those lovely buns a little pinch. I’ll behave from now on. I promise.” </p><p>Face flushed; Applejack glared back at her. “Ya better. Otherwise, I’ll buck ya like a mule.” </p><p>Rarity laughed nervously, certain that Applejack was more than capable of following through with her threat. Given how muscular her legs were, a kick like that would be terribly painful. “Duly noted. Just so you are aware, I shall be applying the Vaseline now. Prepare yourself~” </p><p>“Prepare fer—<b>SWEET </b><b>SUFFERIN’</b><b> </b><b>SASAFRASS</b>! <b>WHERE THE HELL DO YA THINK </b><b>YER</b><b> FINGERS ARE </b><b>GOIN’</b>?!!” </p><p>Rarity rolled her eyes. “We need to ensure that your ‘<i>poop chute</i>’, as you so aptly described it, is properly lubricated prior to insertion. That means I need to stick my fingers inside, darling. Now, if you don’t mind, my task would be far easier if you relaxed instead of clenching up tight.” </p><p>“I-I’ll try. Land’s sake! This has got ta be the most humiliatin’ thing I’ve ever done.” </p><p>Rarity began smearing the Vaseline around in slow circles. “Hardly. You’ve nothing to be ashamed of, Applejack. Everything back here is nice and clean. Not a smidge of brown to be found! <i>Ohohoho</i>~ I’ll be finished shortly. Then we can move on to the next part.” </p><p>Haki swallowed hard when he felt a tingle of excitement begin to stir within his lions. “Hey, Sandalwood. Are we going to have to do the same thing with our tails?” </p><p>“Hmm? Oh, not at all. We’ll just tape them on.” </p><p>Haki rubbed the back of his neck. “Then why are you allowing the girls to go forward with this?” </p><p>Sandalwood shrugged. “It’s not hurting anyone and, to be frank, the accessories are quite lovely. I say, let them have their fun. Although, if I were you, I wouldn’t tell AJ there are alternatives.” </p><p>“Hold on a second! Did Rarity know about this beforehand?” </p><p>Sandalwood grinned sheepishly. “Ah… she might have. Like I said, Haki, it’s far too late in the game to make any adjustments to our costumes. They’ll just have to wear the tails they have.” </p><p>Applejack took in a deep breath and prepared herself. “Ok, Rares. Ah reckon I’m ready fer the next step o’ the process. On the count o’ three ya can start ta—EEEEUUUUGHH!” </p><p>“It’s best to get these sorts of things done quickly, if one is nervous. Well done, Applejack! The bulb slipped right in with the barest amount of effort. I must say, it compliments your body paint and farmer’s physique quite perfectly. You truly are the embodiment of a fox girl now!”</p><p>Applejack let out a girlish squeal that Haki had never heard before. He had to admit that it was adorable. She awkwardly waddled around the room, unaccustomed to the presence of a foreign object lodged in a place where, in her humble opinion, things should only ever come out of. Applejack flexed her butt cheeks a few times, trying to figure out how in the world she could comfortably pose in front of a crowd of people like this. The paint hid her rose-hued flesh, but it was evident to all in the room that she was on the verge of dying from sheer embarrassment.</p><p>“Tarnation! Ah can’t git over how bizarre this feels. Can ya even sit down without the damned thing—erm—slippin’ out? I’d rather not have ta put it back in if that’s the case.” </p><p>Rarity chortled. “They’re specially designed to stay in place unless force is applied.” </p><p>“Just dandy. At least Ah don’t have ta worry ‘bout takin’ it out on account o’ havin’ ta number two later on in the day. Eeyep. Mah bowel movements are as regular as the sunrise.”</p><p>Rarity waved her hand. “A little too much information, dear. However, you have an entire room full of people who would be more than willing to assist you, if that were the case.” </p><p>Applejack looked over to her boyfriend for support and realized, with widened eyes, that he’d gotten an erection from watching all of the commotion. Without any clothing to impede the process, she wasn’t sure if Haki was even aware of his arousal. </p><p>Thinking fast to spare him any embarrassment, the blonde farmer grabbed the container half-full of petroleum jelly and scampered across the room over to Haki, hoping that everyone else had been too preoccupied to notice his erection.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tree Hugger felt the need to add her own commentary and gave Haki a double thumbs up. “Nice cock, dude. I can tell you’re a grower, not a shower. Not that I can blame you. AJ is lookin’ outta this world Are you guys gonna bang after this is all over? I totally would.”</p><p>Haki looked down at his waistline and cursed. “Shit! I didn’t even notice until now.” </p><p>Applejack placed herself in front of Haki to block everyone’s view. “There ain’t no need ta apologize ‘bout yer stiffy, so don’t bother. Ah reckon this is mostly mah fault, even though I’m conflicted by yer—uh—honest reaction given the circumstances. Suppose Ah should feel flattered but now ain’t the time fer such matters. Stands ta reason that Ah should be the one ta take responsibility fer mah behavior and make things right.”</p><p>“How exactly do you plan on making things right?” Haki asked hesitantly when Applejack began to lead him away from Tree Hugger so she couldn’t snoop in on their conversation. </p><p>Applejack shuffled her feet while biting her lip. “Ain’t rocket science, sugarcube. Figure we could mosey on over ta one o’ the bathroom stalls fer some privacy n’ I’ll help ya rub one out.”</p><p>Haki was both excited and uncertain at the same time. He hadn’t expected his girlfriend to ever suggest such a thing. “I don’t know if that’s such a good idea…” </p><p>“What else do ya plan on doin’? Can’t imagine you’ll calm down anytime soon.” </p><p>Haki hung his head in defeat. “Probably not. Are you sure you want to… relieve me?” </p><p>“Don’t worry ‘bout me. Ah went ahead and masturbated this mornin’ in the field. It was Rarity’s suggestion. Said it would help ta calm mah nerves. Reckon it did, at least somewhat…”</p><p>Haki nearly choked on his own spit. “Outside? In the open?!!”</p><p>Applejack blushed as she played with her hair. “The Acres is private property. S’not like Ah had a crowd o’ onlookers. Figured it was more practical ta do it outside on account o’ the mess.”</p><p>Haki’s penis twitched with excitement, causing a tiny bead of precum to ooze from the tip. “Alright. You’ve made your point. Let’s… get this over with so we can focus on the expo.” </p><p>Applejack clapped her hands to get everyone’s attention. “We’re takin’ a break, y’all! Ah promise we’ll be back in a jiffy.”</p><p>“There’s no rush, darling. By all means, please take your time,” Rarity suggested with a wink, “I could use a cup of coffee myself. Sandalwood, would you be a dear and brew a pot for me?” </p><p>Not wanting to linger any longer than necessary, lest the entire room bear witness to Haki’s bobbling erection, Applejack took his hand and pattered towards the bathroom. Thankfully, the bathrooms were of the single-doored unisex variety that offered the young couple some much needed privacy. Applejack used her thumb to click the lock behind her and immediately started coating the entire length of Haki’s cock in petroleum jelly. </p><p>Applejack licked her lips while cupping Haki’s balls in the palm of her hand, gently caressing them with the utmost care. “There we go. Yer all lathered up n’ ready fer action.” </p><p>When she began sliding her hand up and down his shaft, Haki gasped in surprise. “This is fucking crazy! I’ve never done something like this before in a public bathroom.” </p><p>“Neither have Ah,” Applejack quipped, “but here we are. All ya gotta do is relax and lemme take care o’ ya. Don’t worry ‘bout makin’ a mess. Let it all out whenever ya feel like yer gonna cum.” </p><p>“It won’t be too much longer,” Haki panted, “watching Rarity play with your asshole was hot. Maybe we could try out some new techniques later? Nothing too kinky, I promise.” </p><p>Applejack chuckled despite her embarrassment. “Do ya fancy mah backdoor that much?” </p><p>Haki ran his fingers through AJ’s silky blond locks as she pumped faster, a soft squelching sound filled the tiny room only interrupted by Haki’s occasional moans of pleasure. “You should know by now that I love every part of you, AJ.”</p><p>Blushing profusely from Haki’s confession, Applejack decided to concentrate on making him feel as much pleasure as possible instead of offering her lover a verbal reply. When Haki started clenching butt cheeks together and thrusting his hips forward, Applejack let go of his penis and giggled as it twitched back and forth. He whimpered out of frustration, having been denied the satisfaction of sweet release. She paused for a few moments, then slid her hand up and down his shaft in a deliberately slow manner, milking Haki for all he was worth. </p><p>“Why are you teasing me like that? It’s not fair!” </p><p>With a smug grin, Applejack pressed her finger just underneath Haki’s balls and pumped faster, causing him to cry out from his impending orgasm. His body stiffened for a brief moment, then several thick, sticky strands of his seed spurted onto Applejack’s chest, slowly dribbling down towards her stomach. She walked over to the sink and used a paper towel to wipe off the mess, and did the same for Haki, carefully cleaning his penis to make sure there wasn’t anything left. </p><p>“Feel better?” </p><p>Since he was standing right next to the toilet, Haki took the opportunity to relieve himself. “Sure do. I just—are you sure you don’t want me to return the favor? We’ve got time before the expo.” </p><p>Applejack wrapped her arms around his waist and pulled him in close for a hug, nuzzling her cheek against his back. “Nah, I’m alright. Ya can do that later when we’re alone. Fer now, I’m happy that Ah was able ta give ya hand. Uh—somewhat in the literal sense, Ah reckon. Heh.” </p><hr/><p>Once Haki finished washing his hands, he cupped Applejack’s cheeks and kissed her on the lips. While the kiss itself was brief, they remained in each other’s embrace for a time, sharing a laugh at the strange situation they found themselves in. Before joining their friends back in the prep room, the young couple made sure to hydrate and, in Applejack’s case, guzzle down some much-needed caffeine in the form of coffee. Like clockwork, Rarity stood by the pot, sipping her own cup with a knowing smile. She looked every bit the mischievous feline she was painted to be. </p><p>“I presume you took care of our intrepid lion’s ‘<i>not so little</i>’ problem?” </p><p>Applejack took a long swig before answering. “Ah jerked him off in the bathroom fer yer information. Assumin’ ya don’t git up ta anymore mischief, we should be right as rain.”</p><p>Rarity started choking on her coffee, not expecting such a blunt response. “A simple ‘<i>yes</i>’ would have sufficed, dear. Ladies shouldn’t kiss and tell. It’s improper.”</p><p>“Never been a lady; don’t plan on bein’ one.”</p><p>Rarity sighed. “Ever the tomboy. You know, if you were more fashion conscious—”</p><p>Applejack arched her brow, crossing her arms underneath her breasts. “I’ve been a naturist since the day Ah was born, Rares. Mah consciousness regardin’ fashion extends ta when Ah absolutely need ta wear clothes. Matter o’ fact, yer lucky Ah even agreed ta go along with this scheme o’ yers given how you’ve behaved so far. Next time ya feel like playin’ grab ass, I’ll slap ya silly.”</p><p>“Like I mentioned before, I simply could not help myself. However, I recognize that I violated your personal space. For that, I sincerely apologize, but I do not regret my actions.”</p><p>“Water under the bridge, Ah suppose,” Applejack admitted after scratching her stomach, “say… do these tails make yer rear end sore once they’re removed? Considerin’ that they’ll be in all day long, I don’t wanna be hobblin’ along like some bow-legged cartoon cowboy when this is over.”</p><p>Rarity scoffed, looking at her glossy black nails. “I, for one, believe that you should be able to take a break from the monotony of farm life for a single day! I’m certain your family would understand, given the circumstances. As I recall, your siblings are quite capable, no?” </p><p>Applejack shifted uncomfortably. “That ain’t the issue at hand. Ah don’t wanna inconvenience mah family fer a stupid reason. If there’s some kind o’ cream that can help, I’m game.”</p><p>“Or more accurately, you don’t want to tell them the truth.” </p><p>Applejack rubbed her arm. “S’not like Ah could lie ta ‘em. A little bit o’ teasin’ from mah folks is ta be expected, but Granny’ll try ta soothe mah sore keister with one o’ her old-timey remedies or bring up some raunchy tale from the days o’ her youth that no granddaughter in their right mind would wanna hear ‘bout. It’s a scenario Ah intend ta avoid, whenever possible.” </p><p>“Sometimes, I forget what it’s like to live with family. I’ve been on my own for a while now.” </p><p>Applejack shrugged. “Ain’t necessarily a bad thing fer the most part. There are times when a gal’s gotta have some privacy without her folks snoopin’ ‘round. I’ll figure somethin’ out.” </p><p>“Why don’t you ask Haki if you can stay over at Zecora’s house after the exposition has concluded? Certainly, there’s no harm in that. The two of you are already an established couple and you wouldn’t need to worry about bringing over a change of clothing.” </p><p>Applejack chuckled awkwardly and blushed. “Don’t imagine we’ll do much sleepin’ tonight. Uh—well—hypothetically speakin’, o’ course! Ah haven’t decided on a plan just yet.” </p><p>Rarity chortled, patting her friend’s shoulder. “I envy you, darling. What a spirited relationship you two have~ If only I could be so fortunate to find my own prince charming…”</p><p>“Ta be honest, Ah thought I’d be set after this mornin’. But when I had Haki’s—can’t afford ta be thinkin’ ‘bout hanky-panky right now! Gotta git mah head in the game. Act professional.” </p><p>Rarity nodded in agreement. “You and me both!”</p><p>“Say, Rares. Erm—mah tail ain’t gonna slip out on account o’ movin’ ‘round, is it?” </p><p>A creepy smile spread upon the fashionista’s lips. “What kind of amateur do you take me for, Applejack? Of course, not! They’re designed to fit snugly unless one pulls with effort.” </p><p>“Makes me feel a little better, Ah guess. Still embarrassin’ though…” </p><p>Rarity waived her hand dismissively. “Don’t fret about it. Focus on modeling, dear.” </p><p>And so, with their break finally finished, everyone convened in the auditorium watching as the university staff set up the stage. Unbeknownst to Applejack and Haki, part of the exhibition included elaborate background scenery for the models to pose in front of in order to create a more immersive experience for all of the guests who paid for tickets. There was even a small pit orchestra warming up. Confused, Applejack walked over to Fluttershy and tapped her shoulder. </p><p>“Beg yer pardon, Shy. Do ya mind explainin’ what this fancy setup is all ‘bout?” </p><p>Fluttershy shuffled her feet and blushed, brushing a strand of her pink hair away from her face. “Oh—well—I figured it would be more interesting if everyone moved around a bit instead of just standing still. Think of it like a nude cosplay ballet. Expect… maybe not that formal.” </p><p>“That’s—uh—not exactly what Ah was expectin’ but it’ll help keep me busy.” </p><p>Fluttershy bit her lip. “Sorry, Applejack. I didn’t mean to keep it a secret from you and Haki. With all of the excitement going on, I forgot to mention it. I hope you can forgive me…” </p><p>“S’alright. Ah ain’t mad. Any kind o’ dance moves Ah ought ta try out in particular?” </p><p>“Not really. Rarity said that nude bodies in motion are usually captivating enough on their own. It’s just a suggestion… but—you could try behaving like animals? Maybe that would help.” </p><p>Applejack shrugged. “If ya say so. Don’t expect me ta win any awards on account o’ mah performance. C’mere Haki! Let’s brainstorm fer a spell. Apparently, we gotta dance.” </p><p>The young Zebrican padded over to his girlfriend from across the stage. “Dance? What the hell? I don’t remember anyone mentioning that during the briefing.” </p><p>“Mhmm. It was all Shy’s idea. Forgot ta mention it to us, she claimed. Figure Ah don’t have an issue with movin’ ‘round in mah birthday suit while on stage. Everybody’s gonna see all the nooks n’ crannies anyway.”</p><p>Haki rubbed his hands together, blowing out a short puff through his lips. “I’d be more nervous about this but after what you did in the bathroom, it—ah—really mellowed me out. Thanks.”</p><p>Applejack blushed profusely, refusing to meet his eyes. “Don’t mention it. Seriously. I’m more worked up than an ornery mule on a hot day. Thought Ah wouldn’t be on account o’ what Ah did this mornin’ but no such luck. Once this whole exhibition thing is over, Ah might need ya ta take care o’ mah needs. The—erm—adult variety. Ah figure spendin’ some time away from mah folks is warranted, so would ya mind if stayed at yer aunt’s house fer a spell?”</p><p>“Sure. I-I mean yeah… that sounds like a plan.” </p><p>Applejack leaned over and kissed him on the cheek. “Appreciate it, sugarcube.”</p><p>Holding hands, the mixed couple walked out onto the stage and joined the other pair of participants. Applejack and Haki were visibly nervous, which prompted Sandalwood to place his hands on their backs and whisper a quick word of encouragement before the curtains were lifted. </p><p>“Don’t worry about choreography. We’re not a ballet troupe. Just do whatever feels natural~” </p><p>Applejack scrunched her toes, fidgeting in place. “Ain’t never been a talented dancer. What if folks don’t like mah moves and wind up leavin’? I’d hate ta ruin this whole venture…” </p><p>Sandalwood chuckled. “Oh, I very much doubt you will. They’ll be focused on <i>other details</i>.” </p><p>“Those—uh—aren’t exactly the words o’ encouragement Ah needed ta hear right now.” </p><p>Sandalwood shrugged. “Perhaps not. Look, Applejack, all you really have to worry about is looking good for the audience. You’ve clearly got that part covered. People want a show. So, give it to them. Accentuate the human form. Be wild and free! The same goes for you, Haki.” </p><p>With that, nothing more was said as the curtain began to rise, revealing a packed auditorium. The stage lighting focused on the pairs, then a pleasant sonata rose from the orchestra pit. After taking in a deep breath and blowing it out through her nose, Applejack focused on the task at hand and intended to do exactly what Sandalwood suggested. If they wanted a show, she’d give them one they’d never forget. Losing herself in the music, she let her body move to its flow. </p><p>As the performance continued, Applejack barely noticed the audience anymore. She looked into Haki’s eyes, who smiled back at her. He, in turn, let the rhythm guide his feet. It was as if they were the only ones in the room. With a nod, he held out his arms and lifted her into the air, mimicking a ballet. Unbeknownst to the couple, the audience sat transfixed by their graceful routine. They danced across the stage, in complete harmony, as they let go of their inhibitions.  </p><p>Apple Bloom leaned over to whisper in Granny’s ear. “Applejack sure does look pretty up there dancin’ ‘round the stage. Maybe Ah ought ta consider doin’ somethin’ like that in the future.” </p><p>“Eeyep. Showin’ folks what her mamma gave her. Handsome Apple Family genes.”</p><p>Big Mac frowned. “Don’t go puttin’ fool ideas in ‘Bloom’s head.”</p><p>“How’s that?” Granny inquired. </p><p>“She’s barely a teenager! Think o’ the trouble we’d git in if she modeled at that age.” </p><p>Apple Bloom raised her brow. “Ah ain’t that stupid, Mac. Talkin’ ‘bout when Ah come of age. Hence, why Ah said ‘<i>future</i>’. Tarnation! Ya got yer feathers all ruffled up fer nothin’.”</p><p>Granny cackled. “Reminds me o’ when Ah posed fer a nudie magazine durin’ mah youth. Weren’t a big deal at the time n’ got me a fat paycheck fer all the trouble. Even managed ta become poster gal of the year. Imagine that! Still got the picture if y’all are interested.” </p><p>“Cool! I’d like ta take a gander when we git back home.” Apple Bloom gushed. </p><p>Mac groaned, rubbing his forehead. “Don’t need ta see yer nudie pics. Eenope.” </p><p>“Why not, boy? Then ya can brag ta yer friends ‘bout havin’ a sexy gramma.”</p><p>Macintosh sighed. “Rather not. Let’s leave it at that.”</p><p>“Fine then, ya sourpuss. I’ll just watch mah granddaughter some more. Hmm. Can’t figure out how them tails stay in place with all o’ that movin’ ‘round. Must be some mighty strong tape.” </p><p>Apple Bloom took a closer look and realized that the tail was sticking directly out of Applejack’s rear end. She blushed at the implication. Not wanting to embarrass her older sister, she decided to try and change the subject instead of explaining. “We’ll just have ta ask AJ when she’s done.” </p><p>Before long, the performance came to an end, the crowd applauding while the curtain closed. Fluttershy stepped out from backstage thanking everyone for their generous donations and inviting the audience to come meet the models for an additional fee. A small portion of people filtered out of the auditorium, but the vast majority elected to stay for the meet and greet. An excited squeal of pure happiness escaped Fluttershy’s lips. The shelter was going to be ok. </p><p>Fluttershy gasped when she walked in on Haki and Applejack sharing a passionate kiss. “Oh, my goodness! I’m sorry. I-I didn’t mean to interrupt such a tender moment. I’ll come back later…” </p><p>“S’alright, sugarcube. We were just finishin’ up. All o’ that dancin’ got us worked up a spell. By mah reckonin’ we’ve still got ten minutes left before the meet n’ greet. Ya need somthin’?” </p><p>Fluttershy nodded. “I’m not here to rush anyone’s break time. I just wanted to say thank you and congratulations. That was a beautiful and inspiring performance. Everyone enjoyed it.”</p><p>Haki chuckled while rubbing the back of his neck. “Thanks. Going out in front of a big crowd wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. Maybe we should try dancing naked more often.” </p><p>Applejack grinned ear to ear while tracing her forefinger along Haki’s bare chest. “A few nekkid dancin’ sessions most certainly can be arranged, if Ah have anythin’ ta say ‘bout it. Especially if it’s at yer aunt’s place tonight.”</p><p>“Aunt Z does enjoy calisthenics. Helps her keep in shape. I’m sure she’d be game to join us.”</p><p>Applejack rolled her eyes, placing her hands on her hips. “I’m tryin’ ta be seductive, ya dunderhead. The horizontal tango? Ever heard of it? Damn near killed the mood. Don’t worry yer braided noggin, Haki. Ah aim ta keep mah promise. We’ll need ta freshen up first—”</p><p>Fluttershy’s face flushed beet red after she raised her hand. “Um. Excuse me. I’m still here.” </p><p>“Shit,” Applejack blurted out, “just forget ya heard any o’ our banter.”</p><p>“I’ll… take my leave now. Good luck with the meet and greet.” </p><p>In truth, Applejack felt far more nervous being surrounded by a crowd of admirers than she did performing on stage. At least then, she could focus on moving her body and staying in tune with her partner. Fluttershy made it very clear to everyone that photos were allowed, but could only be taken with the express consent of the nude model involved. Any inappropriate physical contact or lewd comments were grounds for expulsion from the premises. These were the rules set by Sandalwood prior to the exhibition and so far, it seemed that people respected them. </p><p>After posing for a few photos, Applejack and Haki were greeted by their families. Without hesitation, Zecora embraced her nephew in a bone-crushing hug. “A marvelous performance, Hakizimana. You should be proud of yourself, as I am right now.”</p><p>“I wasn’t sure this was a good idea at first. But it all turned out for the best. Thanks, Aunt Z.” </p><p>Zecora offered her nephew a warm smile. “Indeed. I can sense your growing confidence.”</p><p>Haki chuckled. “Yeah. Maybe AJ’s lifestyle is starting to rub off on me…” </p><p>Apple Bloom followed suit by hugging her big sister. An embrace that Applejack was more than happy to return. After ruffling Apple Bloom’s hair, Applejack accepted a kiss from Granny and a pat on the back from Big Mac. She excused herself for a moment to fetch a glass of water and watched Haki’s backside while he talked with Zecora, admiring the firm musculature. Her reverie was broken when she spotted his tail and where it had been placed. It was faint, but she could see the outline of a strip of tape plastered upon his lower back. Her face flushed red. </p><p>Applejack pulled Haki aside, interrupting his conversation with Zecora. “Hey! What’s the big deal, AJ? I was trying to catch up with my aunt. Why did you grab my—”</p><p>“Yer tail,” Applejack growled, “it’s taped on. Was that an option <b>THE ENTIRE TIME</b>?!!” </p><p>Haki felt his balls shrivel as a wave of cold sweat washed over him. “Sandalwood only told me after the fact. I swear! If it’s any consolation, you really rocked the plug tail. I think it’s sexy.”</p><p>Clenching her fists, Applejack closed her eyes and counted to ten. “Semantics. Although, Ah appreciate the compliment all the same. I’m gonna tan that prissy trollop’s hide fer this! Mark mah words, this is the last time Ah git tangled up in her fetish-fueled antics. <b>RARITY</b>! <b>GIT YER PASTY PALE KEISTER OVER HERE RIGHT NOW</b>!”</p><p>The aforementioned nude fashionista broke out into a cold sweat at the thought of facing Applejack’s ire. Nonetheless, she knew exactly what her farmhand friend was angry about and decided that it would be best to salvage the situation instead of avoiding Applejack altogether. After gulping down two glasses worth of champagne, Rarity shuffled across the room to where Applejack and Haki were conversing. She let out a shuddering sigh.  </p><p>Haki began massaging Applejack’s shoulders in an attempt to calm down his girlfriend. Her yelling had attracted the attention of everyone in the room, causing an awkward silence to ensue. He assured them this was nothing more than a simple misunderstanding between friends. Haki let out a sigh of relief when everyone went back to what they had been doing before Applejack threw her little tantrum. As expected, her muscles were knotted up tight with tension. </p><p>“Hold on, AJ. I know you’re upset; however, you need to ask yourself one question: was wearing a tail butt plug the whole time really all that bad? You seem pretty comfortable with it to me.”</p><p>“Suppose not,” Applejack begrudgingly admitted, “it’s the principle of the thing, Haki. She lied ta me! Ah ain’t gonna take that sittin’ down. No sir! She’s ‘bout ta git acquainted with mah knuckles. Don’t worry; Ah won’t knock any o’ her teeth out. A black eye will do just fine.” </p><p>Overhearing the commotion, Granny Smith stepped in front of her granddaughter and shot the blonde a stern look. “You’ll do no such thing, child. Ah taught ya better than that! If Ah have ta whoop yer ass mahself ta prove a point, Ah will. Go on and take some time ta calm down.” </p><p>Coming to her senses, Applejack hung her head in shame, feeling thoroughly embarrassed by her lack of composure. “Sorry, y’all. Ah let mah temper git the best o’ me.”</p><p>Rarity, who was utterly terrified, summoned enough courage to speak with her friend. “I’m sorry too, darling. You’re right. I was, perhaps, a bit too eager with the plugs. Selfish, I know, but I must agree with Haki. You seem quite comfortable wearing it. Something to consider later?” </p><p>“Ah forgive ya. And—erm—the whole experience does warrant some thinkin’.” </p><p>The two hugged and shared a brief, affectionate kiss on the lips. Applejack was surprised by the gesture but didn’t press the matter, figuring that it was just Rarity being Rarity. “Splendid! I promise that I shall do my best to make it up to you, Applejack. If for no other reason than to regain your trust in me. Again, I apologize for lying to you. That’s not what friends should do.”</p><p>“We all got flaws. How they’re dealt with is the tough part. Consider it water under the bridge.”</p><p>Rarity waved goodbye to her friend. “Very well then. We’ll stay in touch, darling.”</p><p>“Later, Rares.” </p><p>Applejack cleared her throat, trying to get her family’s attention. “Ah apologize fer mah behavior. Wasn’t neighborly of me. I’ve calmed down now. That bein’ said, I want y’all ta know that Ah plan on spendin’ some time alone with Haki at Zecora’s house after the exhibition.” </p><p>Granny Smith snickered at her granddaughter’s expense. “Yer a grown-ass woman, Applejack. How ya decide ta spend yer time is yer business. Have fun with yer sleepover at Zecora’s place. Although, Ah reckon there won’t be much o’ that goin’ on by the looks o’ it. Hehehe~” </p><p>Apple Bloom &amp; Big Mac bit their lips, saying nothing, trying to remain nonchalant. “Yeah, well—that’s what couples do when the mood strikes. Ain’t a crime ta make love.” </p><p>“Never said it was, child.” Granny assured with a knowing grin. </p><p>Having overheard the gist of the conversation, Zecora hugged her adoptive niece as well. “You are always welcome in my abode, dear Applejack. However, I would suggest that you ‘<i>sleep</i>’ in the guest room instead. Otherwise, I might accidentally overhear your nocturnal activities.”</p><p>“Fer Pete’s sake! What’s a gal gotta do ta git some discretion ‘round here?!”</p><p>Zecora’s melodious laughter filled the room. “For your information, I keep a healthy supply of condoms and lubricant in the bathroom should the need arise. Why are you so surprised? I am like any woman with similar needs; bouts of casual sex can be both fun and exciting.”</p><p>Mortified, Haki looked away and grumbled. “TMI, Aunt Z.”</p>
