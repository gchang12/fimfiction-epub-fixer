		<h1>Ponyville Aquarium</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 19</b><br/><br/>Sweet Apple Acres, Ponyville</p><p>Apple Bloom held her left hand up to the light streaming through the tree house’s window in quiet admiration. Her plain, sensibly trimmed fingernails, fit for farmwork, had instead been covered with a coat of ruby red gloss that complemented her hair. Smiling softly she remarked.</p><p>“Hmm. It’s nice ta git gussied up every once n’ while.” </p><p>“I should hope so, darling” Sweetie intoned in her best Rarity impression. </p><p>Shifting in the yellow bean bag chair the tomboyish teenager glanced over at her friend wryly, “No accountin’ fer taste. Hot pink? What were ya thinkin’, Sweetie? This ain’t the 80’s!” </p><p>Sweetie stuck her tongue out as she began to file her friend’s nails. The pale-skinned girl was clad in a silky floral print kimono and had her hair tied up into a prim bun, “Pink is always in vogue. Ask any esthetician and they’ll tell you the same~” </p><p>Apple Bloom furrowed her brow in confusion, “A whut now? Never heard o’ such a thing before ya went n’ mentioned it just now. Besides, I’ve got half the mind ta ask ya why yer ramblin’ on with that high-falutin talk like yer big sister. Is that why yer wearin’ a fancy bathrobe?” </p><p>“<b>NO</b>!” she squeaked, cheeks flushing red. “I’m trying to simulate a luxurious spa trip for my best friend!” Glaring at Apple Bloom she muttered. “It’s called a kimono, by the way and Rarity won’t miss it… much.” </p><p>Chuckling, Apple Bloom reclined in her seat, “In any case, it looks good on ya. Real pretty.”</p><p>“Hmmm, almost as good as this color looks on you. I totally think you should make this your color if you ever do any modeling.” </p><p>“Ya reckon it’s possible fer a plain jane country gal like me ta be a model?” </p><p>Her friend shrugged as she finished shaving the redhead’s nails to shape, “Don’t sell yourself short, AB. You’ve got a fantastic figure and confidence in spades. Those are the sorts of things modeling agencies look for.” Holding the hand up, she asked. “This look good to paint?”</p><p>Apple Bloom blew a stray strand of hair away from her eye. “How’s a gal supposed ta jump start a career like that? Erm–not that I’d prioritize modelin’ over runnin’ the Acres, mind ya. Carryin’ on family tradition is what Ah intend ta do with mah life. But a little side job here n’ there won’t hurt. Do ya happen ta know any decent photographers?” </p><p>“I’m sure if you asked Featherweight, he’d be willing to set up a shoot,” Sweetie hummed as she dipped her brush into a small vial of nail polish. “Any idea what you’d wear?”</p><p>“Nothin’ at all if Ah can help it.” Apple Bloom affirmed nonchalantly. </p><p>Sweetie gave her friend a deadpan look, “Let me get this straight: you want to begin your modeling career by allowing a male classmate, who you barely know, to take photos of you completely <b>NAKED</b>?!!” While Apple Bloom figited in her seat uncomfortably, Sweetie Belle added. “I sincerely <i>HOPE</i> you realize what a stupid idea that would be, Apple Bloom.”  </p><p>“No need ta git sassy with me. Ah was just spitballin’. Like Ah told ya before, Ah ain’t sensitive ‘bout folks seein’ me nekkid. Least of all a boy from our class. Ya know as well as Ah do, if Featherweight tried anythin’ sleazy, I’d give him a black eye fer his trouble n’ wallop his scrawny ass into next week.” Apple Bloom groused while Sweetie began to paint her thumbnail. </p><p>“If you must insist on nude modeling, I could be your camerawoman,” Sweetie mused thoughtfully. “I’m sure Rarity wouldn’t mind if I borrowed her camera for a little while.” </p><p>Apple Bloom snickered, “By askin’ her permission first, o’ course.” </p><p>Sweetie grinned widely, “We could even incorporate some cosplay! You’d make a great <i>nekomimi</i>!”</p><p>“Ah don’t want a repeat of what Rarity put mah sister through durin’ the exhibition.”</p><p>“I promise I wouldn’t do that to you,” Sweetie sighed as she finished Apple Bloom’s thumbnail. “If you ask me, Rarity seriously needs to get laid. It's been way too long since she broke up with her last boyfriend. She’s wound tighter than a cuckoo clock.” </p><p>Rubbing her chin Apple Bloom remarked, “Now that ya mention it, AJ’s been a lot more relaxed since she went n’ got herself a significant other. Johnny too. Granny said it’s on account o’ the sex mellowin’ ‘em out or somesuch. Ah wouldn’t know personally, since I’m still a virgin.” </p><p>“Your cousin adopted the family dress code awful quick,” Sweetie coughed with a slight blush. “As an outside observer of the feminine persuasion, I hereby declare that the male progeny of the Apple clan are generously endowed with manners, reputation, and reproductive organs.” </p><p>“Disappointed that Ah don’t have a spare hunky twin brother?” </p><p>“Maybe a little…”  </p><p>The two friends shared a laugh before settling into a comfortable silence as Sweetie finished painting her friend's nails. After they finished drying, Apple Bloom got to her feet and admired them. Sweetie leant back and raised an eyebrow, “What do you think?” </p><p>“Ya done good. Reckon Ah could prace ‘round the stage right now. Say, do ya mind takin’ a photo with mah phone?” Apple Bloom gushed. “Think of it as yer field audition.” </p><p>Rising to her own feet, Sweetie giggled, “We should probably go outside though. The sunlight will help accentuate and illuminate <i>my subject</i>~” Snagging her friend’s phone from a nearby table, Sweetie followed Apple Bloom out onto the treehouse’s balcony. </p><p>Apple Bloom skipped over to the railing and perched herself upon it. Crossing her legs she flashed a peace sign with her newly manicured nails and grinned, “How’s this?”</p><p>“Super cute!” Sweetie replied honestly as she snapped a picture. Moving in closely she added. “Now put your free hand across your boobs.” As the redhead complied she snapped another shot. “Awesome! Now try giving me something… a bit more sassy and seductive. <b>YES</b>!” </p><p>By the time the impromptu session had finished, Sweetie had taken over twenty different photographs of her friend in various poses. As Apple Bloom poured over them, Sweetie’s attention was drawn towards the ground when she overheard Babs and Scootaloo. </p><p>Babs had insisted on setting up an MMA training area to help maintain her competitive edge. She’d chosen to hang a punching bag beside the treehouse and had cleared a ring for sparring matches. So far, the only one who’d participated in her training regimen was Scootaloo. </p><p>While Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle made their way back to the house for some refreshments, the two remaining teengers faced off for a friendly bout. After an hour of fighting, their skin glistened with sweat from their exertions. Despite this they fought with dogged determination. </p><p>Babs slipped her leg underneath Scootaloo’s and brought them both to the ground with a dusty thud. Similar to her cousins, Babs preferred to don her birthday suit while going about her business at Sweet Apple Acres, no matter what the task might be. </p><p>As a result, Sweetie Belle freely observed Babs’ taught muscles flex along her backside, arms, legs, and shoulders while she attempted to place Scootaloo into a chokehold. The purple-haired tomboy, clad in a black sports bra and spats, wriggled free and pinned her opponent’s legs to the ground with her own. With a sly smile, Sweetie noted the euphoric expression on Scootlaoo’s face. She was clearly enjoying every second of their bout.  </p><p>Growling playfully, Babs propped herself up and grappled with Scootaloo. Their faces were close enough that they could feel each other’s breath while they struggled for dominance. Suddenly, Scootaloo loosened her grip for a brief moment when she became distracted, realizing which part of Babs’ anatomy was currently rubbing up against her leg. Scootaloo blushed profusely and yelped aloud in surprise.  </p><p>“Got ya!’ Babs exclaimed as she overpowered the shorter girl, forcing Scootaloo flat onto her back. She pinned her opponent for several seconds before they carefully untangled themselves. When they finally stood up, she offered Scootaloo a hand. “Nearly had me there. Good form.” </p><p>Cheeks still flushed red, Scootaloo tried to regain some semblance of composure, choosing not to question what had happened during their grapple. “We can’t all be so freakishly strong. Must be a genetic thing in the Apple Family tree. Like packing some serious heat below the belt.”</p><p>Ignoring Scootloo’s crass remark, Babs pressed forward. “Strength isn’t everything, Scoots. Learn to use your speed and dexterity. Don’t be afraid to surprise me. Care for round two?” </p><p>Running a hand through her sweat matted hair, Scootaloo grinned. “Sure.” </p><p>When the two resumed fighting, Apple Bloom interrupted Sweetie’s reverie, “If Scoots really wanted ta surprise mah cousin, she might as well kiss her right on the lips. Uh… the ones on her face, not in-between her legs. That’d be a <i>LITTLE</i> too forward, Ah reckon, and bound ta give Scoots a black eye fer her trouble, if not worse, knowin’ Babs.”</p><p>“<b>I KNOW RIGHT</b>?!” Sweetie groaned. “Those two aren’t exactly being subtle. It’s so freakin’ obvious they’re into each other. I could practically cut the sexual tension with a knife!” </p><p>Shaking her head at the failure of Scootaloo’s flying tackle, Apple Bloom sighed, “Eeyep. Ah dunno what the problem is. Far as I’m concerned, if ya fancy someone, bein’ direct is the best way ta go about the situation. No sense in beatin’ ‘round the bush, figuratively speakin’.” </p><p>A smug grin spread across Sweetie’s lips, “I’ve been watching this rom-com anime where a clueless couple gets together. What if we played matchmaker for them?” </p><p>The farmgirl arched her brow. “Sounds like a hair-brained scheme ta me.” </p><p>“As much as I love her, Scoots is taking forever to get comfortable in her own skin, and by extension, come to terms with her sexuality. At this rate, we’ll be old ladies by the time she asks Babs out on a date. I think we should speed up the process. Nudge them in the right direction.” </p><p>“What do ya have in mind?”  </p><p>Apple Bloom resisted the urge to roll her eyes as Sweetie tugged the front of her kimono like it was a business suit, “Just leave it to me! Any ideas on what those two tomboys enjoy doing?”</p><p>“When Ah visited Babs in Manehatten two summers back, she dragged me ta the aquarium fer a solid three hours. Didn’t our local aquarium git renovated recently?” </p><p>Sweetie clapped her hands together. “It sure did! I hear they added a new shark tunnel. Just think: holding hands, looking up at all the aquatic wonders around you, it’s soooo romantic!” </p><p>“That ain’t a bad plan, actually. How are we gonna git them ta go?”</p><p>Glancing back, Sweetie observed Scootaloo dragging Babs to the ground with her thighs and snickered. “I’m sure we can come up with something~”</p><hr/><p>Babs Seed stifled a yawn as she glanced up at the clock. In another five minutes, she’d be released from the everlasting snorefest that was math class and finally be able to grab some lunch. The fit tomboy was clad in a red crop top and a pair of loose black sweats. </p><p>“Doin’ alright there, Babs?” Apple Bloom whispered from beside her. The redheaded farmer’s hair was tied back by her usual bow and she was sporting a t-shirt and jean combo. </p><p>Babs shrugged. “Meh, just bored and hungry. I don’t understand how you stay focused.” </p><p>“Balancin’ the books is an important part of runnin’ a farm. It’s like solvin’ a puzzle!”</p><p>“Whatever ya say, cuz.” The former Manehattenite ducked her head as their teacher shot them a glare. Setting her mind to her task she muttered. “Doubt I’ll ever use this shit anyway...”</p><p>When the bell finally rang, Babs thrust her first in the air gleefully. Hastily shoving her notes into her bag, she stood up and kicked Apple Bloom’s desk, “Come on! Let’s go! I’m starving.” </p><p>“Hold yer horses. I’m comin’. No need ta git yer knickers in a twist.” </p><p>“As if we ever bother to wear those,” Babs chuckled. Hearing a soft gasp behind her, she craned her neck to glare at the lanky boy with a bowl haircut staring at her. “You heard me right, bucco. We’re going commando and you’re not gonna sneak a peek with that fancy camera of yours. Get lost!” As he scrambled away she turned back to her cousin’s unamused face. “What?”</p><p>Apple Bloom rubbed the bridge of her nose, “Ya didn’t have ta scare the bejesus out o’ Featherweight like that. He was just surprised, is all. Let's hurry before our spot’s taken.” </p><p>The cousins made their way through the throng of students shuffling through the halls and out onto the quad. As the sunlight warmed their bodies Babs smiled and turned her freckled face up to the light. Ponyville’s Mediterranean climate sure as shit beat Manehatten's icy winters.</p><p>“Over here, darlings!” Sweetie’s voice cracked with a squeak. </p><p>Sweetie Belle was sitting at a picnic table under an oak tree in a sleek purple dress. Beside her sat Dinky Doo and Button Mash, the latter sporting his signature propeller cap and the former wearing a grey hoodie. As Sweetie waved cheerfully Babs muttered. </p><p>“She’s still talking like her fancy-ass sister, huh?”</p><p>Apple Bloom pursed her lips. “Mhmm.”</p><p>Returning their friend’s greeting, the Apples settled down at the picnic table and pulled out their lunches. Babs’ mouth watered as she unwrapped a homemade meatball sub, lovelying crafted by her older brother. Jam-packed with protein, it was the perfect meal to help build her growing body. Before she could scarf it down, Sweetie clapped her hands. </p><p>“Babs, it’s rude to eat before everyone else is seated,” Sweetie tittered. “We are still waiting for Scootaloo.” </p><p>Closing her eyes the Manehattenite grunted, “Would it kill ya ta drop that annoyin’ upper crust accent? Hard for me ta take ya seriously when ya sound like you’ve got a golden stick shoved up yer ass. Hah! You’re even doin’ the nose thing.” </p><p>Cheeks slightly flushed with embarrassment, Sweetie cleared her throat. “Hey–uh–you guys like it when I talk that way, don’t you?” Dinky and Button suddenly found their food to be the most interesting thing in the world. “<b>OH COME ON</b>!!” </p><p>Apple Bloom coughed, “Don’t worry; Ah see Scoots comin’ now.” Babs smiled as her friend approached on a skateboard. The athletic girl was wearing a cute purple tank top and a pleated skirt that hung just above the knee. Dismounting, Scootaloo took a seat beside Babs. </p><p>“Sorry I’m late, guys. Mr Doodle droned on with his lecture that ‘<i>could not wait</i>’ till tomorrow.” Cracking out her lunchbox she asked. “What’d I miss?” </p><p>Without further preamble, Babs tore into her meatball sub like a starved prisoner. Beside her, Scootaloo began to eat a chicken caesar wrap while Apple Bloom bit into a good, old-fashioned russet apple. Across the table, Dinky popped open a bag of potato chips while Button chugged down an energy drink. Sweetie, meanwhile, had a tray of sushi laid out neatly in front of her.</p><p>“Before you three arrived, Button and Dinky were just telling me about their date to the Aquarium.” </p><p>Button blinked owlishly. “Our what now?”</p><p>Swallowing a mouthful of chips, Dinky swatted his nose, “The aquarium dummy.” </p><p>“Hold on a second. You two are an item?” Babs asked in between bites of her sub. “Mad props, Button, I misjudged ya. Figured you’d have one o’ those dorky anime pillows for a girlfriend, not the real thing.”  </p><p>Face flushing dark red Button coughed. “Actually I have several–erm–that is to say, I appreciate the compliment, Babs. Thanks.” Swallowing some more g-fuel he added. “Like Sweetie said, we checked out the aquarium last weekend. It was pretty cool, if I do say so myself.” </p><p>Dinky rolled her eyes, “Come on! You loved it there! Didn’t you have fun seeing all the new exhibits? Especially that new shark walk?”</p><p>Babs leaned in. “Wait, you’re telling me this town has a shark walk?” </p><p>“Sure does,” Button replied. “There’s tons of exotic fish, crustaceans, and there’s even a penguin exhibit. We sure had a lot of fun.” </p><p>“More than just fun! It was a blast!” Dinky chirped, wrapping her arm around the boy’s shoulders. “We even made out in the shark tunnel!” The blonde flushed pink and clapped a hand over her mouth. </p><p>The boy started in his seat, “We did?! I mean yeah, we did ha ha ha. She tastes like… muffins.”</p><p>Several moments of silence followed this statement as Babs and Scootaloo attempted to hold back their laughter. Mastering herself Babs rasped, “Cool bro.”</p><p>“I, for one, think that was very romantic,” Sweetie managed between clenched teeth. “Dinky, you didn’t tell me you and Button had gone that… far.” </p><p>The blonde stuck out her tongue, “You don’t know everything, Sweetie.” Nuzzling Button’s shoulder, she added. “Heck, if Button plays his cards right, he might even get to second base!”</p><p>Apple Bloom tapped her water bottle on the picnic table, “You know, girls, it has been a hot minute since we went ta the aquarium. Given the recent renovation, it might be worth checkin’ out. What do ya think, Sweetie?” </p><p>Composing herself Sweetie popped a California roll into her mouth, “Sure. Scoots?”</p><p>The athletic girl rubbed the back of her head. “I’m not… like… super into fish?” </p><p>Wrapping her arm around Scoot’s neck, Babs ruffled her hair fondly, “Ahhh come on! Are you telling me that my favorite sparring partner is a chicken? Don’t worry, <i>Scaredyloo.</i> I’ll hold your hand so you don’t get spooked by the mean, nasty fishies. Hahaha!” </p><p>“Let go of me! I’m not a chicken!” Scoots giggled as she slipped from Bab’s grip. </p><p>Flexing Babs winked, “Keep tellin’ yourself that.” </p><p>“It’s a date then.” Sweetie hummed. </p><p>“Huh?!” The two tomboys chorused as one. </p><p>“We all seem to agree that visiting the aquarium is a good idea,” Sweetie smiled widely. “I think it would be fun! How does this Saturday work for you two?” </p><p>“If my folks don't need any help ‘round the farm, I should be free,” Babs muttered, glancing at Apple Bloom. </p><p>The redhead tossed her apple core into a nearby trash bin, “AJ ‘n Mac can spare us fer a day. It ain’ like Granny n’ yer brother are a couple o’ invalids. They’ll be fine.” </p><p>Scootaloo grinned shyly, “Cool. My aunts are having a date night this Saturday anyway.” </p><p>“Then it’s decided! Thank you for the recommendation, Dinky.” Sweetie gushed. “Onto the next portion of the agenda. I think we should all sign up for Drama Class next semester!”</p><hr/><p>Scootaloo gave a sigh of contentment as she massaged shampoo into her scalp. She had always enjoyed a nice, hot shower, especially after working up a good sweat. It was both hygienic and helped melt away all the stress that had built up over the course of the day. </p><p>Closing her eyes as suds began to drip down her face, Scootaloo let her mind wander. The image of Babs’ tanned skin gleaming with sweat, muscles flexing, intruded on her mind. The world around her faded away while she fantasized about all the naughty things she could do… <i>WOULD DO</i> with Babs. Scootaloo’s not-so-wholesome daydreaming session was rudely interrupted by the bottle of shampoo impacting the tub floor.  </p><p>Heart hammering in her chest, Scootaloo was wrenched back to reality in an instant. With a slight blush coloring her cheeks she scolded herself. “Don’t get ahead of yourself, dummy! You’ve gotta work up the courage to ask Babs out first. Or at the very least, admit that you like her. Fuck. How do I even know she likes girls?” Dunking her head underneath the showerhead once more, Scootaloo scrubbed her scalp harder, rinsing away any remaining suds. </p><p>Anxiety soon replaced Scootaloo’s sense of shock when she thought of today’s trip to the aquarium. Sweetie and Apple Bloom were going along as well, but it didn’t make the situation any less nerve wracking. It was the perfect set for a romantic confession. Or so Dinky would have her believe. Scootaloo couldn’t help but fret over all the ways this could make things awkward for her and Babs. Could they still be friends if she wasn’t interested? </p><p>Stepping out of the shower, Scootaloo grabbed a fluffy orange towel and vigorously dried her body. She started around her torsos before moving down towards her abs and legs. Hair always came last. As expected, no matter how wet and matted down it had been before, her hair sprang right back to being a spiky mess. She made a half-hearted attempt to comb it. </p><p>Scootaloo decided that since she was home alone, forgoing the towel wasn’t a big deal. If the Apple Family could walk around the farm in their birthday suits all day long, why couldn’t she?</p><p>The young athlete hung up her towel on the rack and glanced at her reflection in the mirror. Her mouth suddenly became dry, her stomach swirling with nervous energy. “Holy Crap! I’m really going to do this, aren’t I? C’mon, Scoots! Get your shit together.” </p><p>Before she could talk herself out of it, Scootaloo opened the bathroom door and scampered out into the hall. Suppressing a giggle, she dashed into her room and leapt onto the bed with a soft plop. Blowing an errant strand of hair away from her eye, she looked up at the ceiling. “Now, I just have to figure out what to wear. Not that I’m gonna ask Sweetie. She’ll never shut up if I do.” </p><p>Scootaloo’s room was a reflection of her personality. Posters of pro skaters and BMX stars, most of them women, lined the walls alongside pictures of her friends and family. In one, she and her two BFFs drank milkshakes together, in another, she was riding on Rainbow Dash’s shoulders and in one kept above her desk she was on a dig site with her parents. Old toys and trashy romance novels crowded her bookshelf while her bed was a mess of tangled sheets.  </p><p>Scootaloo’s eyes roamed over to the open closet. The inside was somewhat chaotic, but organized enough to prevent the outfits inside from becoming wrinkly. Even though this wasn’t a one on one date, she still wanted to impress Babs. The million dollar question was: how? Did nudists even care about stuff like makeup and fancy underwear or if you wore a cute dress instead of jeans? She grunted in frustration. </p><p>Hanging in the closet were four viable options. The first was a simple pair of orange shorts, a black T-Shirt and white sneakers. Beside it was her pleated skirt, a crop top and a pair of heels. In the middle was a violet suede suit her father had bought for her a year ago that still fit. Finally she has a pink frilly summer dress with gold accents that Sweetie had given her as a gift on her last birthday. </p><p>“What would Babs find cute?” Scootaloo muttered, crossing her arms. “Hmm. I just can’t picture her being into girly shit.” Pinching the bridge of her nose she sighed, pacing back and forth. </p><p>“Isn’t that your new friend from school?” A familiar raspy voice inquired.</p><p>Blushing profusely, Scootaloo used the dress to preserve her dignity. Turning around she barked, “<b>DON’T COME IN</b>! <b>I’M NOT DONE CHANGING YET</b>!”</p><p>Aunt Loftie raised an eyebrow sardonically as she closed her niece’s door behind her. A tall and willowy woman, Loftie’s pale skin and short blue hair were a contrast to her wife’s curvaceous build and ginger hair. Her severe face was offset by a pair of warm blue eyes. She was wearing a hand knit sweater and a pair of grey slacks. </p><p>“Nothing I haven’t already seen before.” Loftie tousled Scootaloo’s spiked hair fondly. </p><p>“Give me a sec and I’ll throw something on. Otherwise, this’ll get weird.” </p><p>Loftie flicked Scootaloo’s nose with a chuckle, “How you decide to present yourself in this house makes absolutely no difference to either of us, dear. In fact, your auntie and I spent our entire honeymoon frolicing around the French Riviera wearing nothing but smiles and the occasional strap-on. We barely had any time for sleeping, if you catch my drift~” </p><p>Scootaloo didn’t respond, choosing instead to clear her mind of the horrible images that her overactive imagination conjured up in excruciating detail. She had no desire to learn about her aunts’ crazy sex life. But the cat was already out of the bag, so she bit her lip and pressed on. </p><p>Studying the outfits laid out upon the bed Loftie asked. “Hoping to impress your potential beau?”</p><p>Relaxing, Scootaloo let the dress slip out of her grip and onto the floor. “You could say that…” </p><p>“Do you happen to have a picture of her? I’d like to see the ‘<i>Apple</i>’ of your eye,” As Scootaloo let out a groan the taller woman frowned. “What? I happen to think that was quite funny!”</p><p>“Your jokes are as corny as ever, Aunt Loftie,” Scootaloo giggled after she picked up her phone from the nightstand. Opening up Babs’ <i>Friend-O-Verse</i>™ profile page, she scrolled through until she found a picture of the athletic redhead flexing in a tight tank top. </p><p>Loftie snatched the phone and whistled, “Miss Seed certainly has a unique sense of style.” She flicked her finger across the screen. “A bit too–erm–rough around the edges for my taste.” </p><p>“You don’t like her?” Scootaloo asked dejectedly. </p><p>“Don’t fret, dear. Our taste in women is just… different is all. I like mine with a little bit more meat on their bones.” Loftie chuckled as she scrolled again. Showing her niece the photo, she raised an eyebrow. “I take it she shares the same proclivities as her cousin, Apple Bloom?” </p><p>In the photo, Babs was standing in Sweet Apple Acres’s pond with her back to the camera. Even though the water went up to her waistline, it was clear that the red-headed teenager wasn’t wearing a swimsuit. “I see you gave this picture a thumbs up.” </p><p>Snatching her phone back, Scootaloo buried her face in her hands, “Babs is <b>SO FREAKIN’ HOT</b>!!” Sniffing she sighed. “Auntie, I want to impress her! But I don’t know how! <b>TELL ME</b>!!” </p><p>“Calm down. There’s no need to get so worked up. I have an idea” The tall woman sighed. “Asking out your Aunt Holiday wasn’t exactly a cakewalk for me either.”</p><p>Scootalooo glanced at her, “Really? But you two are so perfect together.” </p><p>“Sure. Only after we’ve been married for two decades. However, during my youth, I was a skinny, gangly, awkward girl: fresh out of the closet and tiptoeing on broken glass. I didn’t even know if Holly shared my enthusiasm for the fairer sex, let alone if she’d fancy a beanpole like me.” Loftie ran a hand through her hair. “Regardless, I had to tell her how I felt. Otherwise, it would have eaten me up inside. Trust me; Scootaloo. Regret is a monster no one can tame.” </p><p>“What did you do?” Scootaloo asked, hooked onto every word. </p><p>Loftie smiled softly. “We have some time before your date. How’d you like to hear a story?” </p><hr/><p>Babs Seed had to admit the Ponyville Aquarium made for an impressive sight, despite not being located in a large urban center like the ones she was accustomed to. A shimmering facade of glass and steel rose up in front of her and the rest of the girls, modern architecture subtly designed to resemble ocean waves. In front of the entrance, a marble fountain of a rearing hippocampus surrounded by smaller statues of sharks, penguins, fish and other aquatic life greeted guests as they arrived. </p><p>“They sure didn’t skimp on this renovation,” Babs whistled. “This is going to be cool!”</p><p>“Cooler than a freezie pop on a hot summer day,” Apple Bloom drawled beside her. </p><p>Babs glanced over at her cousin and grimaced, “C’mon, Bloom! Spit that stupid thing out. Ya look like a country bumpkin. It’s embarrassing.” </p><p>The sunkissed teenager raised her brow while she chewed on a stalk of hay with a wry grin. Apple Bloom decided to dress simply for the outing, wearing a pink and red plaid shirt tied up into a crop top, jean shorts, and a pair of comfy sneakers. “News Flash: that’s what Ah am.” </p><p>“Well, ya don’t have ta be so obvious ‘bout it,” Babs grumbled. “Where’s your sense of style, cuz? The aquarium is the kind o’ place ya should dress up for.” </p><p>“Ya dressed up enough fer the both of us, Ah reckon.” Apple Bloom retorted. </p><p>Glancing down at herself, Babs had to admit that Apple Bloom had a point. She’d combed her hair and put on some dark eyeshadow, and glossy red lipstick that complimented her tawny complexion. She’d chosen to wear a white blouse, a burgundy leather jacket and a pleated black skirt. Normally, she would forgo undergarments all together, but Babs decided the sensible thing to do was slip on a pair of orange leggings, lest she offend any of the other guests. </p><p>“If we have ta wear clothes in public, we may as well look good.” </p><p>“Oh, I’m sure it’s the public yer worried ‘bout impressin’.” Apple Bloom teased.  </p><p>Babs bit her lip as Scootaloo’s smiling face flashed in her mind. Shaking her head, she crossed her arms in an annoyed pout. “W-whatever! Let’s get moving.” </p><p>Choosing to ignore her cousin’s disingenuous dismissal, Apple Bloom removed the stalk of wheat from her mouth and flicked it away. “Looks like the girls are here.” She nodded towards a flashy white Sedan that could only belong to Rarity. </p><p>A flurry of butterflies roiled in her stomach as Babs blew a strand of hair away from her eye. “Cool.” </p><p>The Sedan came to a halt in front of them and Sweetie Belle exited the passenger side quickly. Surprisingly, the fashionista’s sister had dressed casually wearing only a frilly blue blouse and a pair of dark slacks. Hanging from her neck was a camera which bounced as she skipped to the backseat and opened up its door with a bow. </p><p>Babs’ attention was directed towards Scootaloo who stepped out of the car. The tomboyish athlete, who didn’t care for dressing up on any occasion, had clearly made the effort to do so this time around. Unruly spikes had been combed and styled into a smooth wave that curled at her neckline. Just a touch of eyeshadow had been added, highlighting her eyes and smile. </p><p>A soft purple dress hugged Scootaloo’s body like a glove, while a thin pink cardigan sweater hung over her shoulders. The orange flower hair clip tucked by her ear sparkled in the sunlight. Scootaloo’s feet were clad in a pair of white sandals that extended slightly past her ankles. In the crook of her arm was a simple, white, faux-leather purse. </p><p>Sweetie had a big smile on her face and rushed up to Apple Bloom. While the two began to chatter about her camera, Babs approached Scootaloo. The latter was blushing profusely and tugging at the hem of dress. </p><p>Babs rubbed the back of her neck. “Sup?” </p><p>Scootaloo’s voice cracked after she laughed a little too loudly, “Hey! My Auntie suggested I wear this today. I–uh–hope it doesn’t look stupid” Scootaloo looked down at the ground, avoiding eye contact. “This is so embarrassing! What was I thinking? Pretty dresses aren’t meant for girls like me…”</p><p>Babs placed her hand on Scootaloo’s shoulder, rubbing it gently. “You look drop-dead gorgeous right now, Scoots. Don’t let anyone tell ya otherwise.” </p><p>A shy smile spread across Scootaloo’s lips. “Oh gosh! Really? It’s not too much?”  </p><p>“Nah. Yer the fuckin’ bees knees” Babs grinned. “Love the hair too. Cute little pin ya got there.” </p><p>A weight seemed to suddenly leave the lithe girl’s shoulders as she straightened up, “This dress used to belong to my Aunt Loftie when she was my age.” Putting a hand on the hairclip Scootaloo smiled. “The hair clip is from Aunt Holiday. It was a birthday present from a while ago. I’ve never… worn it before. Figured today was as good as any day. Heh.” </p><p>“Sweet” Babs agreed. “There’s nothin’ particularly special ‘bout what I’m wearing.” </p><p>“Regardless, you look cute,” Scootaloo replied. “I didn’t realize you liked wearing girly stuff.”</p><p>The Manehattenite shrugged, “For the most part, I’m just like you. Girly shit just winds up gettin’ in the way. <b>BUT</b> I do have a feminine side.” Tugging her coat flat she added. “Glad ya like it.” </p><p>“If y’all would rather stare at each other all day instead o’ the fish, be mah guest. Otherwise, we’re leavin’ ya behind.” Apple Bloom called out, interrupting their somewhat awkward exchange. </p><p>Sweetie raised the camera for a candid shot, “Not before I get a picture of them together!” The amateur photographer giggled as her shutter clicked. “You two are adorable, you know that?” </p><p>“Yeah, of course, we are,” Babs replied, striding forward and shoving the camera away.  “C’mon Scoots, let's go have some fun.”</p><p>The lineup to get into the aquarium was relatively short. After only a few minutes the girls had reached the ticket booth. A young woman with bright electric blue hair and a broad smile staffed the entrance to the aquarium. She was wearing a standard-issue polo shirt with the Aquarium’s logo. Pinned to the front of her shirt was a name tag reading <i>Sonata.</i></p><p>“Hiya girls!” Sonata chirped. “Welcome to the Ponyville Aquarium, home of the best fish tacos in the valley!” Her purple eyes gleamed with playfulness. “Come to see our new shark tube walkway or better yet our adorable little penguins?”</p><p>Babs fished out some cash and put it on the counter, “We’re here for the whole package.” </p><p>Sonata nodded sagely as she counted the money, “Sweet! You two on a date or something?” She placed her chin in her hand as she studied them. </p><p>Scootaloo flushed, “No–uh–we’re just hanging out… <b>AS FRIENDS</b>.” </p><p>“Yeah, it’s a group outing,” Babs mumbled, jerking her thumb at Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom. “All four of us.” </p><p>“Whatever you say,” The woman shrugged as she handed over the tickets. “Photography is permitted but don’t tap the glass. When you enter, proceed counterclockwise, ok?” </p><p>Babs took the tickets, “Thanks.” She grunted as Sonata grabbed her hand and leaned in closely. </p><p>“Psst. The best place to make out is in the shark tunnel,” Sonatta whispered, waggling her eyebrows. “But you didn’t hear it from me…” </p><p>Flustered, Babs pulled away, unable to come up with a good answer to the employee’s suggestions. Glancing at Scootaloo, she managed to grin. “Come on, Scoots. Let's go.” </p><hr/><p>Scootaloo did her best to act casual as she walked beside Babs through the aquarium. Aunt Loftie was right, dressing up elegantly had somehow managed to impress the girl of her dreams. Given that Babs had also dressed up was a good sign. Even though it was technically a group outing, Scootaloo felt that it could be considered a legitimate date. Deep down, she hoped that things would continue to go smoothly.  </p><p>Even the aquarium itself had been tolerable so far. The underwater-themed motif continued as they walked along. Rather than a grid pattern, the interior exhibits were designed with gentle curves, almost like the current of an ocean. Dozens of children, teenagers and parents walked through them, gazing at the fish swimming beyond the glass. </p><p>“Come over here!” Babs called out from across the room. The tough-as-nails MMA fighter was gone and in her place was a bright-eyed teenager excited to see the exotic fish swimming around. Scootaloo had to admit that it was a side of Babs she hadn’t seen before. She took a moment to admire how cute Babs was and sighed to herself contentedly. </p><p>“So–uh–what am I looking at?” Scootaloo asked, genuinely curious. </p><p>“You’re telling me you don’t recognize them? They’re fuckin’ clown fish! Geez, Scoots. Get with the program.”</p><p>A riot of colorful fish of every shape and size swam in front of Scootaloo’s eyes. They danced around a large mass of rock and coral spotted with anemones, seagrass and dozens of other examples of undersea plant life. The skater stroked her chin thoughtfully. </p><p>“Oh yeah. Hehe. Wasn’t there a movie about them a few years ago?” </p><p>Babs rolled her eyes and pouted. “<i>Finding Filburt</i>. Do you know how freaking hard it is to relocate an entire coral growth like this, not to mention populating it with the big eight? Clownfish, giant clams, potato cod, angelfish, hell they even got some manta rays!”</p><p>Scootaloo gazed at the gliding ray. “I like that one. Kind of looks like a bat but fishy.” </p><p>Babs nodded in agreement. “This exhibit is beautiful. Breathtaking, even. I’m impressed.” The redhead turned and began to walk towards the next exhibit. </p><p>“Almost as breathtaking as you…” Scootaloo responded, voice barely above a whisper. </p><p>Enamored by the aquatic life that surrounded her, Babs blinked owlishly. “Huh? Did ya say somethin’, Scoots?” </p><p>A flood of panic washed over Scootaloo smothering the confidence that had filled her chest earlier. Now, her stomach felt like it was doing backflips. She couldn’t confess with such a corny line! A better, no, more romantic opportunity would need to present itself. Then, she would tell Babs how she felt. “I-I was just wondering where Sweetie and Bloom went!”  </p><p>“Looks like they ditched us.” Babs glanced around. “I bet they aren’t even trying to enjoy the exhibits. All they care about is taking some stupid pictures. Let’s try and find ‘em.” </p><p>“Well, I like them,” Scootaloo said as they walked through a dark corridor past a tank filled with brightly coloured jellyfish. Her eyes widened as a massive luminescent jellyfish floated into view. Its body was at least the size of Big Mac’s torso and its tentacles were easily taller than Scootaloo. “What the hell is that thing??!”</p><p>Smirking Babs wrapped an arm around her, “That is one of the world’s biggest jellyfish, little chicken. A Lunar Jellyfish. That guy is so big he can pretty much eat just about anything.” </p><p>“Yay. Nature certainly likes to keep things interesting.” </p><p>Chuckling Babs guided Scootaloo towards the exit. “The beauty of life, Scoots.” </p><p>As they walked into the next room the space opened up and sunlight shone through the top of the glass enclosure. Scootaloo’s ears perked up as the sounds of squawking filled the air. Glancing towards the craggy rocks that made up the exhibit she let out a girlish squeal. </p><p>“<b>OH MY GOSH, PENGUINS</b>!”</p><p>Tearing away from Babs, Scootaloo raced towards the penguin habitat with a smile on her face. Taking up almost two-thirds of the room was a series of deep pools of water with little islands rising from them. Crowding the rocks and the pools were several species of penguins. </p><p>Pressing her body up against the glass Scootaloo hopped with excitement as she gazed at each bird in kind. Here was a gaggle of Chinstrap Penguins preening their feathers as they crouched atop an island. Waddling towards the water was Humboldt Penguin who pushed a grumpy-looking crested Fiordland Penguin straight into the water. Racing beneath the surface was a pair of blue fairy penguins who chased one another in circles. </p><p>“Awww, they’re so cute!” Scootaloo giggled, clapping her hands.</p><p>Bab snorted as she caught up to her errant friend, “Finally found a sea critter that suits your fancy, eh? I should have pegged you for a penguin gal.” Glancing over at a nesting pair of Emperor Penguins she sighed wistfully. “Majestic aren't they?”</p><p>Scootaloo pressed her nose against the glass as one of the fairy penguins swam up to investigate. Gazing into its beady little eyes the tomboy felt her heart melt even further. As it flapped its little flippers and turned around she glanced up at Babs, “They’re super cute but super stinky. I guess that’s to be expected, given how much fish they eat.”  </p><p>“Yeah, they’re not perfect, but that doesn’t stop them from being adorable.” Babs’ expression seemed to suggest that she was referring to Scootaloo more than the birds. Before she could formulate a reply, Babs glanced over her head. “Would ya look at that.” </p><p>Following Babs’ line of sight, Scootaloo found her missing friends. Apple Bloom was posing in front of some rockhopper penguins, arms spread out against the glass. Sweetie meanwhile was crouching down in front of her, camera in hand as she sought to grab the best possible angle. </p><p>“Who’d have thought AB would be into modeling of all things” Scootaloo remarked as she returned her attention to the exhibit. The penguin handler had entered with a bucket of fish. As the feathered fowl crowded around him he started to toss them out to the waiting birds. </p><p>“Seems that way. I say more power to her. It’s great that Apple Bloom finally found a hobby to pursue outside of slopping hogs and picking apples all day. Talk about a stick in the mud,” Babs shrugged. “At least she’s not camera shy. Hell, I’d even go so far as to call her photogenic.” </p><p>Biting her lip Scootaloo shuffled her feet, “Apple Bloom is cute and all but I think you look much<b> </b>better naked. Uh–<i>TOTALLY</i> didn’t mean that in a creepy perverted way–it’s just that well… you’re not exactly shy about showing off some skin. None of your family is for that matter.”</p><p>“Don’t sell yourself short, Scoots. You’ve got a great figure too,” Babs responded with a warm smile, “It’s particularly noticeable when you got some of that spunky mojo goin’ on. Remember: a little confidence goes a long way.” Glancing around she offered her hand for Scootaloo to hold, which she took without a moment’s hesitation. “Wanna check out the sharks next?”</p><p>“I’d like that. A lot.” Scootaloo replied, praying that Babs didn’t notice she was starting to sweat.</p><p>Leaving the adorable penguins behind, the two girls traveled down another corridor and past a sea lion exhibit. What looked to be most of the aquarium’s patrons were gathered around watching a show starring a wetsuited handler and several sea lions. The sight filled Scootaloo with fresh resolve. With everyone else distracted, the shark walk would be the perfect time to confess her feelings to Babs. </p><p>She hardened her resolve as they walked into the mouth of the shark tunnel which was sculpted to resemble a giant great white shark. Once they passed under its teeth the distant cheers from the show faded away. The bright overhead lights were replaced by soft blue light emanating from strips along the floor. </p><p>“Holy shit.” Babs whispered, glancing around. “Look at ‘em.” </p><p>Scootaloo clutched Babs’ hand a little tighter and pressed herself up against her companion’s side. They were surrounded by sharks. Logically, Scootaloo knew there were several feet of glass between them and the sharks, but she still felt a little unnerved by their presence. </p><p>A trio of great white sharks prowled above them like the monsters from a horror movie. Clinging to their lower bodies were several remora feeding off of their hosts' dead skin. To the girls’ right a hammerhead shark lazily brushed up against the glass, as if scratching an itch. Everywhere Scootaloo and Babs looked they saw more sharks and several types of exotic fish. </p><p>“Looks like we got the place to ourselves!” Babs beamed as they walked further. </p><p>Glancing up and down the length of the tunnel, Scootaloo realized Babs was right. They were completely alone. Scootaloo was so nervous that her voice nearly squeaked before she spoke. “Babs, there’s something important I have to–” </p><p>“We can watch them in that viewing area!” Babs interjected, pulling her along. Scootaloo frowned but followed Babs to the middle of the tunnel which bulged out into a small viewing area with a few padded seats. Babs sat down and patted the seat beside her. “Wanna join me?”</p><p>“Sure,” Scootaloo mumbled, heart thundering inside her chest. Dim lighting, all alone, sitting side by side? If this wasn’t the perfect time, there wouldn’t be another like it. She had to act. “So–uh–I just wanted to say that I really like spending time with you.” </p><p>Babs glanced at her friend. “Good. I like spending time with you too. It’s fun.” </p><p>Frustrated, Scootaloo almost lost her temper, but clamped down on the urge and tried to better articulate her feelings. “That’s not exactly–fuck–I’m not very good at these sorts of conversations. I-I mean I <i>LIKE</i> spending time with you… as <i>MORE</i> than a friend.” </p><p>The awkward silence that followed was the longest fifteen seconds of Scootaloo’s life. Every waking moment that Babs didn’t respond felt like a hot knife being driven deeper into her heart. Just as she was about to stammer it had been a joke, Babs made a noise that was something between a snort, giggle, and hiccup. Confused, Scootaloo could only gawk helplessly. </p><p>Babs rubbed her eyes, a wide grin spread across her lips. “Looks like ya beat me to the punch for once.” </p><p>“REALLY!?” Scootaloo shouted hope blossoming anew in her chest. “I wasn’t sure if you liked girls or… uhh… was looking for anything serious.”</p><p>Taking Scootaloo’s hand, Babs sighed, “Sort of. My brother and I just moved to town and I was worried about opening myself up, ya know?” Rubbing her eyes with her free hand she smirked. “In the big city, ya gotta be like one of these sharks. Always movin’, never stayin’ still. That’s how I got by despite how fuckin’ terrible life was at home.” </p><p>Scootaloo felt her cheeks flush when Babs cupped her cheek with her free hand. Leaning in close, the freckled girl grinned crookedly, “Life’s been good lately, though. My family loves me, Johnny finally has a career and I finally got a dedicated training partner.” </p><p>“More than that, I’d wager.” Scootaloo remarked with a playful pout. </p><p>“Seems only fair to reward such a wager,” Babs replied huskily, eyes filling Scootaloo’s field of vision. Her dreams were finally coming true. This was it, their first kiss! </p><p>The magical moment was spoiled ever so slightly by their noses colliding with one another. Pulling away Babs giggle-snorted and cocked her head to one side. Seizing the initiative, Scootaloo leant in and felt an electric thrill as their lips met. </p><p>For several seconds Scootaloo whooped for joy internally while they embraced. Her arms wrapped around her companion’s muscular back, holding her tight. Babs, for her part, lifted Scootaloo so she was sitting in her lap.</p><p>“Umm, not to ruin the mood, but shouldn’t we be doing something with our tongues?” Noting how red Bab’s own face was, she asked. “You’ve done this before, right?”</p><p>“Not really…” Babs responded honestly. “Maybe if we just keep trying we’ll figure it out?” </p><p>“Sure thing… babe,” Scootaloo ventured meekly. She was rewarded with a toothy grin from her girlfriend who grabbed her face in both hands and dragged her to her own. </p><p>After catching her breath, Scootaloo laughed and looked up at the circling sharks, “You know, I think this place is starting to grow on me.” Giggling she dove back down into her new girlfriend’s embrace. Life was looking up for Scootaloo. That much was certain.  </p><hr/><p>Apple Bloom could barely contain her excitement as she sat with Sweetie outside the aquarium’s gift shop. The plucky farm girl had bought herself a pair of cheap red sunglasses while Sweetie had picked out a pink bucket hat with a rearing hippocampus printed on the front. Together the two studied the newly minted couple intently as they approached. </p><p>Babs had one arm around Scootaloo’s shoulder while Scootaloo had her own arm wrapped around Bab’s waist. Their hair seemed a bit messy, almost as if they had run their hands through it. Perhaps most tellingly was a smudge of Scootaloo’s lipstick on Bab’s neck. </p><p>“They totally snogged,” Sweetie affirmed with a triumphant grin, giving the approaching girls a wave. </p><p>“No doubt ‘bout that,” Apple Bloom replied, lowering her sunglasses and staring at Scootaloo’s dorky grin. “Can’t believe this hairbrained scheme actually worked out.” </p><p>Sweetie tipped her hat, “Ponyville's premiere matchmaker was on the case. Was there ever any doubt?” As her friend remained silent the girl’s smile dropped. “This plan was foolproof!” </p><p>“Ah wouldn’t go that far.” Rising from the bench Apple Bloom cracked her neck. “Howdy there, strangers. We lost y’all over at the penguin pit. Everythin’ alright?”</p><p>Babs glanced down at Scootaloo and smirked. “More than alright, cuz. I’ve got myself a girlfriend now!” </p><p>Gasping theatrically, Sweetie clapped her hands together, “How exciting! May I be the first to offer you congratulations! I guess the aquarium really is a fabulous romantic venue~” </p><p>Scootaloo glanced at Sweetie, brows furrowed, “You don’t seem very surprised.” Her eyes widened with realization. “Did you two plan this?! I was gonna ask Babs out eventually!” </p><p>“Whatever do you mean? Surely you can’t-”</p><p>“Eeyup,” Apple Bloom interrupted “Couldn’t bear another week of watchin’ y’all git hot n’ bothered after a wrastlin’ match, makin’ goo-goo eyes at each other. Past time ya hooked up.”</p><p>Deflating Sweetie dropped to the floor, “<b>APPLE BLOOM! YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE SO BLUNT</b>!! Romance takes panache, style and elegance! Have some tact for once…” </p><p>“Thanks anyways,” Babs remarked, ruffling Scootaloo’s hair. “I promise to treat her right.” Gaze drifting to a shelf full of plush penguins her grin grew wider. “What would you say to a one-hour anniversary present?”</p>
