		<h1>Planting The Seeds Of A Brighter Future</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 13</b></p><p>Deluxe Suite, White Mist Resort</p><p>Morning arrived sooner than expected for a certain young couple. Haki laid flat on his back, head resting upon the pillow, observing Applejack as she slept by his side. Judging by the color of the sky outside the window, Haki assumed that it was still quite early but he was too relaxed to get out of bed and bother checking his phone to confirm. Instead, he placed his hand along Applejack’s strong, muscled back and began stroking her skin in an affectionate manner. It was just enough stimulation to rouse her from sleep. </p><p>The young farmer opened her eyes slowly and blinked, trying to make sense of her surroundings. When Applejack finally realized that she was snuggled up against her lover, she repositioned her head atop his chest and placed a gentle kiss just above his stomach. Their naked bodies thus became a contrast of tangled limbs in the early morning sunlight. No words were shared between the two lovers for a time. Only comfortable silence ensued. </p><p>Applejack breathed in Haki’s scent and smiled. “Mornin’ sugarcube. How’d ya sleep?” </p><p>Haki ran his fingers through her silky blonde hair and sighed. “Pretty good. Then again you tuckered me out last night. Shouldn’t be too surprising that I slept like a log.” </p><p>A slight blush colored her cheeks. “I’m sorry fer jumpin’ in ta things so fast. S’not normally somethin’ I’d be inclined ta do but… Ah felt bad ‘bout not spendin’ enough time with ya. Reckon mah womanly instincts took over and—erm—well, ya know the rest.” </p><p>“My poor sore Johnson can attest to that. You milked me till the very last drop!” Haki joked. </p><p>Applejack turned even redder as she poked Haki’s stomach. “The feelin’s mutual, buster! Mah cooter’s gonna be achy n’ tender fer a while, Ah suspect. Damn it! I’m never gonna live this down. Can’t very well waddle around the farm like a penguin with an ice pack stuck ta mah crotch. Do ya think it’ll last that long? I’ve never—uh—had ta deal with this problem before.” </p><p>“It’s not like we have to go back to Ponyville right away, Applejack.”</p><p>Before she had the chance to come up with a response, a series of loud knocks echoed throughout the room. Roz’s distinct, muffled voice suddenly became much clearer when she burst through the door. Upon seeing her friends cuddled together in bed as lovers are often wont to do, she coughed and shuffled her feet awkwardly, hands placed behind her back. Not bothering to cover up, the young couple continued to snuggle as they shared a heavy sigh. </p><p>Applejack lifted her head slightly. “Roz, ya know it’s rude ta burst into a couple’s room.” </p><p>Roz looked down at her feet and twiddled her fingers. “Yes, I know. But this is a matter of some urgency. My driver just called and said that he will be arriving at the resort within the hour. While I too would like to stay here a little while longer, transportation would be difficult to arrange otherwise. I’m deeply sorry if I interrupted your intimate bonding experience.” </p><p>Haki sat up and rolled his neck from side to side. “Hmm. I don’t think we’re in a position to argue this one. Alright, Roz. Give us like fifteen minutes to get dressed and shower, then we’ll meet you at the café for breakfast. C’mon, AJ. We’ll hop in together to save time.” </p><p>While tempting, Applejack and Haki did not engage in any canoodling while they showered. They both understood that Roz was their only reliable source of transportation from White Mist Resort, so they kept things quick and efficient. Applejack, in particular, was glad that she didn’t smell like sweaty sex anymore but the soreness in-between her legs persisted.  To that end, her stride was somewhat awkward while she walked down the hall, since she’d have to wait until they got back to Sweet Apple Acres for a proper ice pack. </p><p>Breakfast was a simple affair. Coffee and rice porridge served with a side of grilled fish. Not exactly the hearty country fare Applejack was accustomed to, but it wasn’t the worst thing she’d eaten for her morning meal. Before long, they were loading their baggage into the trunk of Roz’s fancy Russian car and heading towards Ponyville while the sun crept above the tree line. Applejack rested her head against Haki’s shoulder while they sat together holding hands. A loud yawn escaped her lips and her eyelids began to feel heavy. Within moments, she was fast asleep. </p><p>Applejack was jolted awake by Haki’s sudden disappearance, or rather when she realized that she’d been sleeping on the car seat for some time. It helped that Roz had been doing her best to rouse her friend by shaking her shoulders repeatedly. Grumpy and disoriented, the blonde famer glared daggers at Roz while she tried to regain her composure. Applejack wiped a little trail of drool that had formed along her chin. After yawning again, she smacked her lips.  </p><p>Roz clapped her hands together. “We have finally arrived at Sweet Apple Acres! If you are wondering where Haki is, we dropped him off about twenty minutes ago at his aunt’s house. He said that he didn’t want to interrupt your rest.” </p><p>“S’alright. Must’ve been more tired than Ah thought. Before Ah go on mah way, I’d like ta thank ya, Roz. Haki and Ah wouldn’t have been able ta share—uh—take our relationship further without yer help. Let yer aunt n’ uncle know that we wouldn’t mind visitin’ again.” </p><p>While Applejack was busy opening the trunk, Roz hugged her from behind. Made all the more obvious when her bare breasts squished up against Applejack’s back. Roz was the only one amongst the trio who hadn’t bothered to get dressed when they departed White Mist resort. Whether or not that was done with purposeful intent was anyone’s guess.</p><p>“It was my pleasure! Pardon my curiosity, but I must know something before we part ways. How did Haki perform in the bedroom? He looks like he would be an agile lover. Did you assume any wild positions—”</p><p>Applejack let out an irritated sigh. “No can do. That’s privileged information, Roz.”</p><p>Roz giggled. “I understand. But it must have been good considering the way you have been waddling around all morning. Hmm. Haki did have quite a sturdy third leg, no?”</p><p>Applejack blushed and rubbed the back of her neck. “Fine. I’m sore down there. Ya happy?” </p><p>Roz kissed her friend’s cheek. “I am! Don’t fret, Applejack. Such is to be expected of your first time. I find that a frozen bag of peas helps to reduce the soreness. It will take time to go away.” </p><p>“Yer probably right on that account. Reckon I’ll have ta bribe Apple Bloom ta fill in fer mah chores. Or at least, the heavy-liftin’ kind. Land’s sake. Granny’s gonna have a field day with this. Ah just know it. She’ll be wearin’ a shit-eatin’ grin fer the foreseeable future…” </p><p>Roz smiled. “Goodbye for now, Applejack. I shall see you later.”</p><p>The pale-skinned goth waved goodbye as the car pulled away while Applejack waved in return. Afterwards, she slung her suitcase over her shoulder as she approached the farmhouse on account of the wheels being completely useless on gravel roads. No one was around to greet her as she opened the door. This, in and of itself, was unsurprising. Applejack suspected everyone was out tending to the trees, the still, or a host of other farm-related chores. </p><p>Such was life at Sweet Apple Acres. Figuring that she’d have plenty of time to pack later, Applejack dumped her suitcase near the closet and immediately began taking off her shorts, t-shirt, and kicked off her sneakers. The shirt and shorts were neatly folded, then put away in the dresser drawers for another day. She didn’t bother to throw anything in the hamper since they’d only been worn for a few hours at most. Laundry wasn’t exactly a high priority on the farm. </p><p>Now that she’d donned her favorite outfit since birth, Applejack padded into the bathroom and stood bow-legged in front of the mirror. A frown spread across her face as she surveyed her abused lady bits. “Damn it! No wonder I’m so sore. Everythin’ is all red n’ puffy. Might as well be honest with mah folks, on account o’ the fact that Ah won’t be able ta hide it from ‘em.” </p><p>Out of an abundance of caution, Applejack used two fingers to spread a glob of cool, soothing aloe lotion along the inside of her salmon-pink folds, wincing whenever she happened to touch the particularly tender spots. With the unpleasant deed done, she grunted in pain, hobbled down the stairs, then headed towards the kitchen in search of an ice pack. Much to her chagrin, Apple Bloom was sitting at the table with Winona by her side, enjoying a glass of lemonade. </p><p>“Nice ta take a break after workin’ yer keister off all mornin’, eh girl?” </p><p>The border collie barked once and began wagging her tail while Apple Bloom wiggled her toes through the fur along Winona’s back. The teenager giggled at how soft it was.  </p><p>“Oh! Howdy, Applejack. Ah didn’t realize you’d come back already. Welcome home!” </p><p>Applejack ruffled her little sister’s hair affectionately. “Thanks, sugarcube. The trip was nice n’ all, but it’s good ta be back on the farm. Say, ya wouldn’t happen ta know if there’s any ice packs up in the freezer, would ya? I’m feelin’ a might sore n’ need somethin’ ta sooth the swellin’.” </p><p>Apple Bloom looked over at sibling with concern. “Did ya pull a hammy? Ah did that once when Ah was cuttin’ up tree stumps with Mac. He had ta carry me all the way back ta the house.” </p><p>“Umm… not exactly.” Applejack replied hesitantly. </p><p>Without elaborating any further, Applejack shuffled towards the fridge and opened up the freezer compartment above. After peering at its contents, she concluded that there were no ice packs to be had. Some frozen steaks, a bottle of expensive looking vodka, fruity freeze pops, and two bags of peas comprised the entire inventory. Reluctantly, Applejack grabbed a bag of peas, made her way over to the couch, and sat down as carefully as she could. With a resigned sigh, she spread her legs apart, and placed the frozen vegetables over her sore privates. Apple Bloom, now finished with her lemonade, came scampering over to the living room along with Winona. </p><p>Apple Bloom stood in front of her sister, winced, and rubbed her arm. “Dang. Ah didn’t realize ya hurt yer coochie, AJ. How’d that happen? If ya don’t mind me askin’ that is…” </p><p>“Let’s just say that Ah got mahself involved in a situation without thinkin’ ‘bout the consequences first. Not that Ah completely regret it, mind ya, just that—it’s complicated.” </p><p>Apple Bloom’s confusion only grew. “Care ta elaborate? Ah don’t have a clue what yer talkin’ ‘about. Is this some sort o’ adult business that ya think Ah ain’t old enough ta understand yet?” </p><p>Applejack cleared her throat. “As a matter o’ fact it is adult business. Tarnation! Ah reckon there’s no sense in bein’ cryptic ‘bout the matter or you’ll just keep askin’ questions. So—erm—Haki and Ah did the couple’s tango at the resort last night and I’m… mighty sore down there. Ya happy now?” </p><p>“Oh. Is everyone’s first time really that painful?” The teenager asked with genuine curiosity. </p><p>Applejack sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose, wishing that she wasn’t having this particular conversation with her little sister. “Ah don’t rightly know, sugarcube. Up until last night, Ah was still a virgin. Suppose we got caught up in the heat o’ the moment n’ started makin’ love like a pair o’ horny jackrabbits. Should’ve taken things at a slower pace.”</p><p>Apple Bloom twiddled her fingers and looked down at her feet. “Can’t say I’ve never seen Haki nekkid before. Does he have a big pecker like Mac? Is that… why yer coochie hurts so much? Gosh! Ah dunno if Ah like the idea of havin’ a boy slip inside me if it causes that much pain.” </p><p>Thoroughly embarrassed, Applejack blushed from her cheeks all the way down to her freckled breasts. “Well, no. Haki ain’t quite as big as Mac. But—uh—he’s no slouch either. Might be thicker all around than Mac. Ah dunno! S’not like Ah compared their bait n’ tackle side by side!”</p><p>Granny Smith chose that exact moment to enter the living room with Mac close behind. By the looks of it, they’d worked up a good sweat tending the stills and were looking to cool down with a refreshing beverage and lounging around in the air conditioned house. Apple Bloom took a peek at her brother’s flaccid penis while he drank a carton of milk and frowned. She’d seen the organ plenty of times before, even when it was standing at full mast in the morning. That was never a big deal. However, a million questions began to swirl around inside her mind. Was making love to someone you cared about really that great if it caused your partner so much pain? </p><p>Sensing her granddaughter’s unease, Granny placed her hand on Apple Bloom’s shoulder and used the other to swig from a canteen full of whiskey. “The reason why yer sister’s so sore is because she had sex without thinkin’ ‘bout the consequences afterward. Ain’t that right, dear?” </p><p>Applejack wanted nothing more than to bury her head into the pillows, scream, and pretend that the outside world didn’t exist. “Reckon that’s a fair assessment, Granny. Ah underestimated how thick his pecker was n’ just how little wiggle room there was inside o’ me. Haki was sore afterwards too. Not sure if it was ta the same degree but—erm—Haki did mention it ta me.” </p><p>“Yer a strong, well-built young woman, Applejack. It’s ta be expected that yer clam’s gonna be tighter than a bowstring. That’s why they invented lubricants, child. Didn’t ya use some?”  </p><p>Applejack bit her lip. “Nothin’ beyond what Ah was already makin’ mahself… down there.” </p><p>Granny placed her hands on her hips and snorted. “<b>PEH</b>! Poor, ignorant child. No wonder yer kitty feels more stretched out than an old rubber band. Let the pain be a lesson ta ya, Applejack. Suppose Ah shouldn’t be too surprised by this turn o’ events. You’ve always been squeamish ‘bout physical intimacy. Not ta mention, this was yer very first time bumpin’ uglies with a man.” </p><p>Apple Bloom furrowed her brow in confusion. “What do ya mean by ‘<i>with a man</i>’, Granny?” </p><p>“Folks don’t have ta restrict themselves ta one type o’ partner, Apple Bloom. Two women can make love together. Same applies ta men. Ah though they taught young-ins that sort o’ thing in school nowadays. What has this world come ta?! No wonder y’all are so confused n’ clueless.” </p><p>Apple Bloom hummed while rubbing her chin in thought. Then a look of comprehension dawned upon her face. “Ah never thought ‘bout it that way… but yer right, Granny. Ta be honest, Ah feel a might foolish fer not realizin’ it earlier. These sorts o’ things ain’t easy ta ask ‘bout regardless.” </p><p>“O’ course, I’m right. Old farts like me have been ‘round the block a few times. Never be sorry fer askin’ questions ‘bout life, sugarcube. Ah promised y’all a long time ago that I’m more than happy ta share a few nuggets o’ wisdom with mah grandkids. Even if the topic at hand happens ta be nookie. No shame in it, remember. All part o’ the grand circle o’ life and whatnot.” </p><p>Apple Bloom plopped onto the couch next to her sister, and reached over to place her hand atop Applejack’s thigh, caressing it gently. “Fer what it’s worth, Ah hope ya feel better soon.” </p><p>Applejack wrapped her arm around Apple Bloom and pulled her in for a half hug. “Ah appreciate the sentiment, but Ah reckon I’ll be outta commission fer a while.”</p><p>Granny took another swig of whiskey and sighed. “The chores are pretty much done fer the day anyhow. Rest up while ya can, child. Mac, Ah know ya were listenin’ in on our conversation. Go on and git yer keister in here n’ join us. I’ve got somethin’ I’d like ta discuss with y’all.” </p><p>Just as Granny predicted, the burly farmer came padding into the living room not but a moment later with a bottle of water in hand. The couch was big enough that he took a seat next to Apple Bloom and planted an affectionate kiss on her cheek when they cuddled up closer to one another. The jovial atmosphere from before vanished almost instantly when Granny began to pace back and forth, a serious expression stretched across her wrinkled face. She put down her silver whiskey flask on the coffee table nearby and took in a deep breath. </p><p>“Ah received a call from yer cousin the other day. Not gonna lie ta y’all: it wasn’t a pleasant conversation. Johnny made it clear that there’s trouble in the household.” </p><p>Apple Bloom gasped. “What kind o’ trouble? Is Babs alright?” </p><p>“As a matter o’ fact, she ain’t. Neither o’ ‘em are at this point. Apparently, yer aunt has decided ta run off with some good-fer-nothin’ drug peddler and yer uncle… well, he’s sucked at bein’ a father n’ a husband since day one. Johnny asked me if they could stay with us here at Sweet Apple Acres. Ah want ta emphasize that this’ll be permanent. They ain’t goin’ back ta Manehatten. Since this is just as much yer farm as it is mine, Ah wanted ta run it by y’all before Ah gave him mah answer. I’ll let ya take a moment between yerselves.”</p><p>Applejack’s emerald eyes burned with righteous fury as she gripped the couch cushion. Mac remained stoic but held his youngest sister close while she cried into his chest, running his fingers through her hair occasionally as a gesture of comfort. Granny had taken a seat in her favorite rocking chair but said nothing. Instead, she looked down at her feet and frowned. </p><p>Mac was the first to speak. “Ah think we’re all in agreement that they need our help.”</p><p>“Babs was always tellin’ me how awful it was livin’ with her parents. Ah never realized it’d gotten that bad…” Apple Bloom croaked. </p><p>Applejack took in a deep breath and blew it through her nose. “It’s settled then. There’s plenty o’ room here at the Acres fer them ta live with us. Ah say we take ‘em in, no questions asked.” </p><p>Granny smiled. “Yer parents would be proud if they saw y’all today. Apple Bloom, would ya mind helpin’ yer granny set up the guest rooms? The sheets need ta be changed and whatnot.”</p><hr/><p>Babs Seed blew an errant strand of raspberry-pink hair away from her eye as she stared out the car window. She and her brother had been on the road for a few hours now, heading towards the farmstead of their relatives in Ponyville. Very little had been said between the siblings. Not because they hated each other… rather, the tomboyish teenager didn’t know exactly what to say to Johnny. Words simply weren’t enough to convey her relief, her gratitude, her unease. While it was true that she loved her cousins dearly, uprooting one’s life was a daunting process.  </p><p>She focused her attention from the trees passing by to her brother who was busy driving in the seat beside her. Even though his eyes were focused on the road, she could tell that he was pensive. Who wouldn’t be given their current situation? All of their earthly possessions, which didn’t amount to much, were packed in the trunk. Everything they had known in Manehattan was now behind them. Quite literally in this case. Babs played with the edge of her jean skirt and sighed. At some point, they would need to address the enormous pink elephant in the room. </p><p>“Johnny, I want ya ta know that I appreciate everything you’ve done for me so far.”</p><p>Her brother chuckled softly. “You’re welcome, sis. Ta be honest though, I wanted ta get outta that shithole as much as you did. I can only hope things will be better for us in Ponyville.” </p><p>Babs rubbed her thighs together and bit her lip. “Me too. Look—uh—ya know what living wit our cousins means don ’cha? We’ll have ta do chores around the farm ta help earn our keep. But more importantly—the thing is—they’re all naturists. I don’t have a problem wit it, since I happen ta like bein’ naked but… what about you?” </p><p>Johnny gripped the steering wheel and frowned. “I thought about that. A lot actually. I’m not gonna lie, sis; it’s gonna be super fuckin’ awkward trying ta get used ta them bein’ naked all day long. Frankly, I had a hard enough time getting used ta you prancin’ around in your birthday suit back at the apartment. Please don’t take my opinion the wrong way. It’s just… weird for me.” </p><p>“I’m sorry, Johnny. Once Apple Bloom showed me how they live, I didn’t wanna go back.”</p><p>Johnny licked his lips. “Yeah. Pandora’s box n’ all that philosophical shit. Listen, Babs. Ya don’t have ta worry about me. I’ll figure out how ta adjust somehow. Might take a while, but I’ll do it. Besides, what other choice do I have at this point? Beggars can’t be choosers, after all.” </p><p>Babs shuffled her feet. “S’not like they’re gonna force you ta strip. They aren’t like that.” </p><p>“Maybe. Chances are, I’ll be the only one wearing clothes around the farm. Won’t that—like—upset them somehow? It’d be like if I went ta a vegetarian’s house n’ started eating a bucket full of chicken wings right in front of ‘em. Plus, it’ll make me feel like the odd man out.” </p><p>Babs giggle-snorted aloud. It was the first time in a while that Johnny had heard his little sister laugh. The improvement in her mood gave him hope. “Naturists aren’t like that, bro.”</p><p>“I’ll take your word for it. Alright! We’re almost there. Be sure ta be on your best behavior.” </p><p>A large, colorful, hand-painted sign advertised Sweet Apple Acres as being just two kilometers ahead. This was put up to ensure that any suppliers who wanted to do business with the Apple Family would know where to go without getting lost in the process. It also warned travelers that the farm was private property and solicitation or harassment of any kind were not tolerated. Johnny turned onto the long, meandering dirt road and swallowed a lump that had formed in this throat. This was it. They were about to take their first step into a new life. </p><p>It didn’t take long before they reached the main gate. Johnny’s face paled when he saw the naked form of Macintosh standing ready to assist them. At Mac’s behest, they drove further towards the farmhouse, and parked the car inside the barn next to the family truck. Babs exited first, followed by Johnny who opened the trunk and began to unload their possessions. Ever the gentleman, Mac was by his cousin’s side in an instant, offering to help carry the suitcases. </p><p>“Need help with those, Johnny?” Mac drawled. </p><p>“Uh—sure. It’s… nice to see you again, Macintosh.” </p><p>“Likewise. Follow me. I’ll show y’all the guest rooms.” </p><p>The first thing Johnny noticed was how warm Ponyville was compared to Manehatten, despite it being the middle of fall. He supposed that’s why the farm flourished all year round and how this side of the family was able to live the way they had for generations. While they walked towards the farmhouse, which was pleasantly quaint, Johnny tried his best to avoid gawking at the veiny appendage that dangled in-between Mac’s legs. Mentally, he’d tried to prepare himself for just such an encounter but it was difficult to ignore something that was so obvious in person.  </p><p>Johnny winced as they began to ascend the stairs. Everything about Macintosh was big. Hence, the moniker. From his head all the way down to his <s>nutsack</s> feet. Mac’s mountainous physique made Johnny feel uncomfortable, inadequate, and nervous all at the same time. On the other hand, Babs didn’t seem phased by her cousin’s nudity whatsoever. When they finally dropped off the suitcases, Mac extended his hand to Johnny, which he gripped willingly but not with as much raw strength. The burly man placed his hands on his hips afterwards and surveyed the room. A slight smile spread across his lips. </p><p>“Eeyup. Granny n’ Bloom did a good job sprucin’ up, Ah reckon.” </p><p>Johnny rubbed the back of his neck. “Thanks again, cousin. You guys really helped us outta a bind. I dunno if there’s anything I can do ta repay your kindness.” </p><p>“S’not necessary. Family’s gotta stick together through thick n’ thin.” Mac affirmed. </p><p>Johnny coughed awkwardly. “<b>SO</b>! I’ll just… start unpacking my stuff if you don’t mind.” </p><p>“Eenope. I’m gonna head down ta the livin’ room n’ let everyone know y’all have arrived.” </p><p>With that, Mac walked out the door and down the stairs. Just as Johnny was unzipping his own suitcase and putting things away in the closet, Babs immediately began taking off her clothes in the next room over. At fourteen, she was a year older than Apple Bloom. However, due to her poor scholastic performance over the course of the past year (<i>due to a lack of motivation, not intelligence on her part</i>), she’d been held back a grade. A longtime fan of MMA fighting since childhood, Babs regularly trained after school at the local gym in order to hone her skills for the semi-pro league once she turned old enough to compete. It was one of the few places where she felt happiness and the drive to pursue her dream, away from the troubles of home.  </p><p>As a result of her strict MMA training regimen, the teenager’s entire body rippled with muscle just underneath the surface of her tawny, freckled skin. Her firm, pear-shaped breasts weren’t large by any definition, but reasonably sized for a young woman of fourteen. Babs had a figure that most teenage girls would kill for and was proud to display all the hard work that had gone into maintaining it. That, in some small part, was why she felt more confident while in the nude. More importantly, it gave Babs a sense of freedom that she couldn’t experience any other way.  </p><p>Unlike her younger cousin, Babs enjoyed painting her nails and had gotten two piercings. Both were simple silver studs; one near her nose, and the other in her belly button. Her finger and toenails were painted cherry red to accentuate her emerald green eyes. Makeup wasn’t something she concerned herself with every single day but on occasion, Babs would wear eyeliner and a little blush. In terms of grooming habits, her preferences differed with Apple Bloom as well. While just as thick, her pubic hair was kept in a neatly trimmed triangular patch. </p><p>Knowing full well that she’d be living with a family of naturists for the foreseeable future, Babs had opted to pack light in terms of the clothing she’d brought along. Most of it was plain t-shirts, jeans, and an assortment of somewhat flashier undergarments. She figured that more could be bought at a later time when the need arose. With the last of her earthly possessions stowed away safely, Babs padded over to her brother’s new room and knocked on the door softly. </p><p>“Need any help unpacking, bro? I’m finished.” </p><p>Johnny sighed when he spotted his little sister leaning up against the doorway. “Ya certainly didn’t waste any time takin’ your clothes off, did ya, sis? Anyway, I’m just about done. If ya gimme a minute, we can head on downstairs together and say hi ta everyone.” </p><p>Babs went first, followed close behind by her brother. Unlike before, Granny, Mac, Apple Bloom, and Winona were all gathered around the couch. Without a moment’s hesitation, Apple Bloom practically jumped out of her seat and wrapped Babs in a bone-crushing hug. A few tears were shed, but otherwise, the two cousins were happy that things were finally starting to head in the right direction. Babs joined Apple Bloom on the couch afterwards. </p><p>Never a big fan of hugs, especially from naked family members, Johnny knelt by the rocking chair and ruffled Winona’s fur instead. The border collie ate up the attention with gusto, wagging her tail back and forth rapidly. Sensing her grand-nephew’s discomfort, Granny opted to place her hand on his shoulder instead of the traditional hug. She knew it would take some time for Johnny to adjust to the new normal. Completely uprooting one’s life tended to be a process, after all. </p><p>“Welcome ta Sweet Apple Acres, young fella.” Granny said with a warm smile. </p><p>Johnny stood up and mustered his best smile. “Thanks, Granny. I’m sorry for skipping out on all the hugs and kisses, but—um—that doesn’t mean I’m not grateful for all of ya takin’ us in.” </p><p>“Pay it no mind, child. Our way o’ life is different from most folks. Those who ain’t used ta it, tend ta find the lack o’ boundaries a might unsettlin’. Take as much time as ya need ta adjust. Oh! Ah ought ta mention that nudity ain’t compulsory ‘round here. Ya can keep yer clothes on if that suits yer fancy. Or take ‘em off. Makes no difference ta us. Yer still family either way.” </p><p>Johnny rubbed his hands together. “Good. Babs took ta the whole nudist thing like a fish in water. Ma didn’t really care that much, but then again, she never cared about much of anything other than her next fix. Pop, on the other hand… he thought it was inappropriate. As for me, I’m somewhere in the middle. Seeing her roam around naked still makes me feel uncomfortable, but Babs is old enough ta make her own decisions. If it makes her happy, I’m all for it.”</p><p>Granny nodded. “Ya got a good head on yer shoulders, Johnny. I’m certain yer little sister appreciates all the love n’ support you’ve shown her. Alright! Enough o’ this sappy stuff. Time fer victuals. After such a long journey, y’all must be hungry. We’d be terrible hosts if we didn’t fill yer bellies. C’mon on in ta the kitchen. There’s plenty ta eat.” </p><p>Babs’ stomach growled in protest as she padded into the kitchen with Apple Bloom. Her older brother took a seat next to Mac, while Applejack rooted around the fridge, looking for something to serve everyone. As a result, the blonde farmer was bent over with her tan, freckled rump pointed towards the table, wiggling it on occasion. Babs saw her older brother turn beet red, desperately trying to maintain his composure but eventually, he had to avert his gaze. </p><p>“Here they are,” Applejack exclaimed, “whipped up these here club sammiches fer y’all.” </p><p>Babs practically wolfed down the triple decker sandwich, enjoying the salty, smokey goodness of the turkey, ham, and bacon, all squished together between layers of mayo and lettuce. Johnny quietly nibbled on a section that had been cut into thirds, keeping his eyes glued to the plate. Applejack took her seat carefully, making sure not to further aggravate her injury. Her crotch had slowly begun to feel better after some rest and further application of aloe gel. However, in doing so, she had to keep her legs spread apart. This was the exact moment Johnny looked up. </p><p>Applejack glanced over at her cousin with concern. “Ya alright, Johnny?”</p><p>Still choking, Johnny took a big gulp of water and cleared his throat. “Yeah. Food went down the wrong pussy—erm—I mean pipe! I’ll be fine. Just need some more water.” </p><p>Blushing, Applejack rubbed the back of her neck and chuckled awkwardly. Johnny’s Freudian slip had not gone unnoticed. “Uh… sorry. Ah didn’t mean ta flash mah cooter in front o’ ya, Johnny. Modesty ain’t exactly a concern amongst us naturists, if ya catch mah drift.”</p><p>Babs rolled her eyes. “Stop being such a big baby, bro! This is how it’s gonna be from now on. Ya might as well get used ta it now. So, go on and stare until it’s outta ya system.” </p><p>Thoroughly embarrassed, Johnny buried his face in his hands. “Easy for youse ta say, Babs! You’re practically a naturist already! Look, I’m sorry everyone. This is just too fuckin’ weird for me. Can’t deal wit this shit right now. I-I gotta go. Thanks for the sandwich, AJ. It was tasty.”</p><p>With that, Johnny abruptly left the table and stormed out the front door to get some fresh air. Feeling guilty, Babs got up out of her seat to follow her brother, but was stopped by Mac’s strong grip. “Let ‘em go. Sometimes, a man’s gotta sort things out on his own.” </p><p>Applejack shook her head and frowned. “Ah feel lower than a snake’s belly. Should’ve known that Johnny would be outta his element ‘round us. Is there any way we can make ‘em feel more comfortable? It’s just that… Ah dunno if Ah can consciously remember ta cover mahself up.”</p><p>“Eenope,” Mac rumbled, “he’s livin’ in our house, by our rules, regardless o’ the circumstances. Ain’t no reason fer ya ta be ashamed o’ what ya were born with, AJ. Like Babs said: Johnny’s gotta learn how ta adjust ta our lifestyle accordingly. Although, Ah would’ve gone ‘bout the matter with gentler words. Have some pity on the poor fella. He’s been through hell.” </p><p>Babs slumped in her seat and shuffled her feet underneath the table. “What you’re sayin’ makes perfect sense, cuz. But I still feel crummy about what I said to him. Me and my big mouth!”</p><p>Applejack placed her hand on Babs’ back and rubbed it gently. “We all make mistakes, sugarcube. Just give yer brother some time alone, n’ apologize ta him later. Ah reckon it’ll be a long, awkward, painful process, but—uh—he’ll come ‘round eventually.” </p><p>“Johnny’s never been self-confident about his body. Maybe that’s why he’s so afraid ta take his clothes off around us. I dunno. It might be the fact that he’s the only other guy here besides Mac, who gets ta hang out wit a bunch of teenage girls. Hard ta say at this point…” </p><p>Applejack hummed. “Ah suppose I’m still technically considered a teenager. Babs, don’t take this the wrong way, but has Johnny ever had any inappropriate relations with ya?” </p><p>“Never! He’s not some creepy-ass pedophile. I swear on my life! I’m just sayin’ that Johnny ain’t exactly a social butterfly. Ya know, it’s not every day he gets ta see a naked girl in person, let alone three at the same time… in the same place.”</p><p>Granny cackled. “Oh? Ah don’t count as a foxy lady, eh?” </p><p>Babs waved her hands. “No—I mean, ya look great for someone your age, Granny.” </p><p>“Ah wasn’t bein’ serious, child. Rest assured, Ah know what ya meant.”</p><p>Mac lumbered over to the fridge, grabbed a pair of beer bottles, then closed the door. “Lemme handle this y’all. Situation calls fer a bit o’ delicacy. I’ll try ta smooth things over with Johnny.”  </p><p>Babs was just about ready to bolt out of the kitchen past Mac, but he stopped her by holding his arm out. The athletic teen knew that she could put him in an arm lock if push came to shove, but didn’t want to cause a ruckus with her new hosts. Instead, she let out a resigned sigh, slumped her shoulders, and began ascending the staircase. Apple Bloom’s bare feet pattered against the floor while she followed Babs out of the kitchen. So hurried was her gait that she nearly tripped and hit her head against the banister in the process. </p><p>“Hold on, Babs! Wait fer me!” </p><p>Babs glanced down at her younger cousin. “I’m just goin’ up ta my room ta do a set of pushups. If I can’t help Johnny right now, then I might as well do somethin’ productive. You’re welcome ta join me, but it’ll be pretty boring. I don’t like talking while I’m in training mode.”  </p><p>Apple Bloom scrambled up the stairs, panting. “S’alright. Ah can do sit ups or somethin’.” </p><p>“Not a great idea considering that ya just ate.” </p><p>Apple Bloom placed her hands on her hips and huffed. “Neither are pushups, ya doofus. Ah saw how fast ya wolfed down that sammich. There’s no way yer tummy’s had a chance ta settle yet.”</p><p>Babs blushed slightly and invited Apple Bloom into her room. The younger girl proceeded to plop belly-first onto the bed and kick her legs in the air. “Ya got me there, cuz. Guess we can just hang and talk. I dunno. Feeling frustrated when you can’t do anything sucks…” </p><p>“We could head over ta mah room and play video games.” Apple Bloom suggested.  </p><p>“What kind of games do ya have?” </p><p>“Scoots seems ta like the violent ones, but Ah prefer lighter fare. How ‘bout <i>Tonio Party Four</i>?” </p><p>Babs shrugged. “Alright. Lead on, AB.” </p><hr/><p>Unlike the Manehatten, Sweet Apple Acres was a peaceful place. Instead of honking horns, police sirens, and construction work, there were only the sounds of birdsong, insects, and a gentle breeze drifting through the orchards. With significantly less light pollution, it made the sunsets more spectacular to behold. Johnny Apple-Seed found himself drinking in said scenery whilst trying to make sense of what his life had become. Confusion was at the forefront, followed closely by embarrassment. He kept reminding himself that nudity was the norm around these parts, but to actually experience it in person was another matter altogether. Especially, when three of those people happened to be teenage girls. Applejack’s presence, in particular, had stirred up some conflicting emotions that Johnny didn’t want to dwell upon too deeply.  </p><p>Johnny blew out some air through pursed lips and rubbed his face. “I shouldn’t have gawked at Applejack like that. She’s my fuckin’ cousin for Pete’s sake! Even if she happens to be a <i>VERY NAKED</i>, attractive young woman. Why do I gotta be such a creep about this? There’s no way I can go back in there and expect any semblance of normalcy. Shit! What the hell do I do?”</p><p>Nothing but the sound of crickets answered him. He sat in contemplative silence for what felt like an eternity until he heard the screen door squeak shut. When he turned around, Mac stood behind him with two beers in hand, and offered one to drink. Johnny accepted the beverage willingly, and proceeded to twist off the cap. Without saying a word, Mac took a seat next to him on the porch and took a big swig of beer. Johnny continued to look out towards the orchard. </p><p>“Ah saw how ya were lookin’ at mah sister.” </p><p>Johnny winced. “Go on and punch me. I deserve it.” </p><p>Mac shook his head. “Eenope. S’not how Ah feel ‘bout it, and neither does AJ.”  </p><p>“Doesn’t that make me a total creep? Mac, I know she’s my cousin but—”</p><p>The burly farmer held up his hand. “Who ya hardly ever see ‘n is only two years yer junior. I’ll be honest with ya, Johnny. AJ’s always been the type o’ gal who doesn’t quite grasp how pretty she is. Been that way fer years. Ah suspect her perception on the matter’s startin’ ta change on account o’ that art class she’s been posin’ fer. Even so, it’s an on-goin’ process.” </p><p>“Apple Bloom seems a little naïve too, for that matter.” </p><p>Mac leaned back and crossed one leg over the other. “Ta a lesser extent, Ah suppose. Their lack o’ modesty, as ya might call it, is the result o’ livin’ buck nekkid since childhood. Same applies ta me. We figure that every nook n’ cranny that can been seen has been seen at some point. Therefore, it ain’t a big deal ta any o’ us if we bend over, squat, or scratch our privates.”</p><p>“Makes sense in a weird way. All I’m sayin’ is that it will be a while until I get used to seeing more of everyone’s… anatomy than I would reasonably expect in a normal living situation.” </p><p>“Nobody expected otherwise, Johnny.” Mac agreed. </p><p>“What should I do about AJ then?” </p><p>Mac shrugged. “Look at ‘er body if ya feel it’ll get this infatuation outta yer system. Ah reckon the more ya git ta know her, the less difference it’ll make that she’s nekkid as time goes by. Who knows? Ya might even consider takin’ yer clothes off durin’ the process someday.”</p><p>“Ok. I’ll give it a shot. Uh—speaking of time, I’ve been thinkin’ about something else. I’m gonna need a job if I stay here. The one I had before isn’t really an option since we don’t live in Manehattan anymore. Is there anything around the farm I could help out wit?” </p><p>Mac rubbed his chin in thought. “As a matter o’ fact, there might be. Ah could use an extra hand at the stills. It’s hard work, ‘n requires precision. Think ya might be up fer the task, Johnny?” </p><p>“A still, ya say? Sounds interesting. I worked as a full-time bartender downtown for a while, so I’ve got some ideas on what ya could do with your booze. It’s strictly hard liquor, right?” </p><p>“Fer the time bein’,” Mac affirmed, “but I’ve been thinkin’ ‘bout diversifyin’ our line.” </p><p>“What? Like hard cider?” </p><p>Mac nodded. “Eeyup. It’s popular with the younger crowd. Could make us a hefty profit.” </p><p>For the first time since arriving at Sweet Apple Acres, Johnny smiled. “I don’t know that much about cider brewing but I’m sure we could learn the process together. Count me in!”</p><p>Rather than worry about Applejack or adjusting to life with a family of nudists, Johnny was content to enjoy the remainder of his beer with Mac and watch the sunset as it painted the sky orange and purple. The one emotion he’d dared not feel for so long, blossomed in his chest. Hope. Hope for his little sister, and that of his own future in a sleepy town called Ponyville.</p>
