		<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Apple Family has been tending Sweet Apple Acres ever since Ponyville's founding. They're simple folks. Real salt of the earth. Tend to keep to themselves. Except there's one thing about the Apples that sets them apart from the rest of the people residing in Ponyville: they've lived as <span style="font-style:italic;color:#E97135">naturists</span> for generations.  </p><p>Applejack, the eldest daughter, just recently graduated from high school. She's looking to attend Canterlot University, so that she can earn a degree in business management. Granny Smith agrees to help pay for her granddaughter's education under the conditions that she forms some lasting friendships and is more open about her lifestyle with people outside the family. Unfortunately for Applejack, that's easier said than done.</p><p>A collaborative story between <a href="/user/48989/Enclave2277" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#2CAF26">Enclave2277</span></a> and <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/travolore" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#2CAF26">Travolore</span></a></p>	</body>
