		<h1>Sizzle Fizzle Toil And Trouble</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 8</b></p><p><i>Cala Concha</i>, Rarity &amp; Braeburn’s Suite </p><p>The dawn of our third day together at <i>Cala Concha</i> arrived far faster than I anticipated. With everything that had happened yesterday, I suppose it shouldn’t have been that much of a surprise to me. Time flies when one’s having fun, after all. I rolled over in bed and watched as Braeburn slept peacefully beside me. He looked so serene that I didn’t want to disturb his slumber. With that in mind, I carefully extracted myself from the covers and padded out to the kitchenette. </p><p>A shower would come later. For the time being, I was more interested in brewing a fresh pot of coffee instead. I mean, it’s not as though bathing was that much of a hassle, given the fact that I didn’t have to worry about wearing anything for the remainder of the day. Besides, I’d already taken one yesterday evening. I couldn’t very well go to bed with frizzy, saltwater-soaked hair. Don’t even get me started on my skin! I spent nearly a half hour applying shea butter moisturizer everywhere possible. Braeburn, of course, enjoyed watching me do so the entire time.  </p><p>I smiled to myself while the coffee pot started heating up. It was such a wonderful feeling, as a woman, to know that you are loved and desired. Ever since our wild little romp on the beach, Braeburn began showing physical affection towards me on a more regular basis. Such as kisses along the neck, caressing my skin, snuggling, playing with my hair, and the occasional bottom tweak. Mind you, most of this was kept between us, within the privacy of our own suite but I considered it progress. It gave me hope that he would eventually come to enjoy social nudity. </p><p>I carefully opened the patio doors and allowed the fresh ocean breeze tickle my bare skin. It felt absolutely lovely~ The sun was just beginning to rise over the horizon and I could hear the seabirds chattering amongst themselves. Upon taking in a deep breath, I pondered what I would do before eating breakfast. Normally, I would engage in a bit of light yoga just to get the blood flowing and stretch out my limbs. I’d neglected to take along my trusty mat, so that was out. </p><p>There was always the possibility of stepping outside to perform a few sets directly on the beach. However, I had no desire to be coated in gritty, white sand all over again so soon. That left me with my Judo stances. I preferred to do them on a flat, padded surface but carpet would do just fine in a pinch. Judo was a martial art that used throws and grapples most of the time. Therefore, I focused my sets on upper body movements, and added a few kicks just to round things out. </p><p>By the time I was finished with a dozen sets, I started to work up a sweat. Since I was feeling thirsty, I walked over to the fridge to fetch a bottle of water and nearly chugged down the whole thing in a matter of seconds. Only after that point did I feel like I was ready to pour myself a cup of coffee and rest for a bit. It wasn’t the vilest stuff I’d ever drank, but it certainly wasn’t what I would call high quality arabica. In all likelihood, I’m sure the coffee they served at the cafeteria tasted better. Oh well. I didn’t feel like going the whole way down there just for a drink.</p><p>I stood in the patio doorway and watched the ocean while I nursed my mug full of coffee. An older couple were out for a morning jog and waved to me, I returned their greeting politely, albeit with less enthusiasm. I wasn’t quite one hundred percent awake just yet. But getting there, certainly. Just as I closed my eyes to savor another sip, I felt a familiar pair of arms wrap around my waist. In a matter of seconds, Braeburn was pressed up against my back, resting his head on my shoulder. I let out a contented sigh and enjoyed his butterfly kisses. </p><p>“Mornin’, Rares. Did ya sleep well?” Braeburn asked. </p><p>“Yes, very well thank you. Pardon me for being so sweaty and disheveled, darling. I just finished up practicing some Judo sets. You know, to get the blood flowing and whatnot.” </p><p>Braeburn inhaled my scent deeply. “No biggie. Ya look and smell great as always.” </p><p>I blushed at how enthusiastic he was about it. “Is that so?”</p><p>“Eeyup. Never been a time where ya weren’t sexy ta me, Rares.” </p><p>My heart fluttered in my chest. “Ever the gentleman, even this early in the morning. Why, one might even say that such flattery could lead to some <i>very</i> interesting consequences…” </p><p>“Hmm. Wonder what those might be?” Braeburn whispered while he slipped his hand in-between my legs. </p><p>I bit my lip and let out a soft moan when he began teasing my folds with the tips of his fingers, inserting them once I became wet enough. Why was he so frisky right now of all times? For goodness sakes! I hadn’t even gotten the chance to take a shower yet. With his other hand, he cupped my breast and began massaging it in slow, lazy circles, teasing my nipple every so often by rubbing with his thumb. After a few minutes, my whole body felt hot. Now, I was excited! </p><p>Just as I was about to have a shuddering orgasm, Braeburn abruptly stopped his ministrations. I very nearly turned around and slapped him. One does not simply tease a lady in such a manner! “Oh, come on! Why on earth did you stop, darling?! We had a good thing—” </p><p>Braeburn grinned and carried me princess style over to the couch and laid me down. “Because I wanna make ya feel even better. Rest yer head on that pillow over there, get comfortable, and stick yer rear end in the air. I’ll do the rest.” </p><p>It was an extremely compromising position to put myself into, but I trusted Braeburn and knew that he wouldn’t take advantage of me or laugh at my expense. My trust was rewarded immediately as I felt him gently pry apart my lips, and expose the glistening, pink flesh of my flower with his fingers. Then came the tongue. Braeburn’s marvelous, dexterous tongue~ Unlike yesterday, his cunnilingus technique wasn’t quite so amateurish this time around. I think it was because he’d tasted me once before and was more confident about what I liked. </p><p>The lewd slurping noises he was making were almost too much for me to bear. I would’ve died of embarrassment had anyone else been around to hear them. Sweet merciful heavens! When he began teasing my nubbin with the tip of his tongue, my body quivered in ecstasy and I gushed like a fire hydrant on a hot summer day. In the back of my mind, I pitied the poor soul who would eventually have to clean the couch after we were finished. I promptly collapsed onto my belly, panting heavily from the blissful orgasm I just experienced. </p><p>When I looked over my shoulder, Braeburn wasn’t on the couch with me anymore. Where on earth could he have scampered off to? I wanted to return the favor and he was nowhere to be found. Fine, be that way! You’ll just have to go without a proper morning fellatio from me then. While I was pouting, I saw him return from the bathroom with a bottle of scented massage oil in hand. He squirted a big glob onto my back and began rubbing it all over my body. </p><p>The massage he gave me was simply divine. In the haze of post orgasmic bliss, my entire body felt like it was floating on cloud nine and my brain, well… let’s just say I wasn’t doing much thinking and leave it at that. Everything felt more sensitive than usual too. I moaned softly while he kneaded my butt cheeks with his fingers, slowly spreading them apart and—wait a moment. <b>NO</b>! He wouldn’t—HE DID! I let out an embarrassed squeak as he exposed my anus. </p><p>“Would ya look at that,” Braeburn commented playfully, “Honestly didn’t expect yer lil’ pink starfish ta be this cute!”</p><p>My entire body erupted in a rosy blush. Why did you have to say something like that? “Braeburn, darling… you really shouldn’t be sticking your fingers there. It’s filthy!” </p><p>“There ain’t a single part of ya that’s filthy, Rares. Just relax and lemme make ya feel good. Ah promise I’ll be gentle about it too. Go on, relax. Unclench yer cheeks. There we go… that’s it.”</p><p>Just like he promised, Braeburn took the utmost care with his ministrations while he massaged my unmentionables. I will admit that it felt good, dare I say it even caused me some degree of excitement to have my… pucker teased in such a way. It took everything I had to restrain the squeaky moan of pleasure that escaped my lips, but escape it did. And wouldn’t you know it. Braeburn had the smuggest look of satisfaction on his face before he bent down to kiss my back.   </p><p>I felt like a giant blob of Rarity pudding but I had enough wherewithal to glance back at Braeburn as he continued to massage me. A carnal hunger filled my loins while I watched his erection bob back and forth. He was so very… <i>stiff</i>. Almost to the point where it looked painful. The whole time, he’d done nothing but selflessly attend to my needs and not his own. I <s>wanted</s> needed to do something for him too! I propped myself up and wiggled my rump enticingly. </p><p>“I cannot express how much I appreciate what you’ve done for me this morning, darling. But right now, I want you to help you sate your own desires. I couldn’t call myself a proper girlfriend if I left my lover… in such a state as that without attending to his needs.” </p><p>Braeburn traced his thumb along the wrinkled edge of my anus. I quivered and gasped. “Like ya told yer sister yesterday, sex ain’t a contest. I’m doin’ all of this because Ah want ta. Makes me happy ta see mah gal when she’s feelin’ good.”</p><p>“Be that as it may, I’d feel even BETTER if you stuffed your thick cock inside me.” </p><p>Normally, I wouldn’t have had the courage to utter something so vulgar. But I momentarily forgot my ladylike manners because I was desperate. My earnest declaration had the intended effect of flustering poor Braeburn. A battle must have been raging in his mind. It was as if he was trying to decide if he should just stick to the plan or mount me like I suggested. In the end, I suppose his own desires must have won out. He squirted another glob of massage oil onto his hands and coated his entire length with the stuff. It practically glistened afterwards. </p><p>I licked my lips in anticipation while he aligned the tip of his manhood to the entrance of my kitty. “That’s it, darling. Just a little more and we’ll be joined as one. I can’t wait until we—”</p><p>The thing about lubrication is that it tends to make everything so much slipperier than usual. Including a penis. Braeburn barely put any effort into pushing forward and within the blink of an eye, he’d stuffed his entire length inside me right up to his balls. Being penetrated so suddenly made me cry out in surprise. It wasn’t exactly painful, but it did take me a few seconds to adjust. </p><p>“Nnngh! Oh goodness! I’m—ok now. You can start moving.”  </p><p>By George did he thrust! The pace at which we made love was much more intense. We were well beyond the exploratory stage of our relationship and simply wanted to feel as much pleasure as possible. Braeburn gripped my buttocks to keep himself stable, while I listened to the lewd sound of flesh slapping against flesh. I swear, there were even a few instances where I felt his balls brush up against me. They were quite hefty and dangled a fair bit, as you might recall. </p><p>I cannot even begin to tell you thankful I was to have an IUD installed just prior to our vacation at <i>Cala Concha</i>. It’s not that I didn’t trust Braeburn to use protection. Rather, I knew for a fact that having sex without a condom felt better for both parties. The possibility of bearing Braeburn’s children wasn’t completely off the table, mind you. I simply had no desire to become pregnant in my early twenties or go through a shotgun wedding with the Apple Family. Such life changing decisions would come later, when we both decided the time was right. </p><p>The tingling haze that I typically associated with an impending orgasm spread throughout my entire body. I was getting so very close! Braeburn’s panting became heavier and his thrusts more frequent as he pushed his hips forward. I suspected that he wouldn’t last much longer either. My mind temporarily went blank as I felt my inner walls constrict around his shaft, milking Braeburn for every last drop of his precious seed. He gripped my buttocks tightly and cried out my name. I moaned loudly in response and plopped my head onto the pillow. Immediately thereafter, I felt a rush of heat enter my belly while he ejaculated into me.  </p><p>Braeburn collapsed atop my back, carefully extracted his slick, semi-tumescent penis from inside me, and began caressing my hair. “Land’s sake. That was the most intense round of sex I’ve ever had. We should try out that position more often, Rares.” </p><p>I giggle-snorted. “Darling, it’s literally the second round of sex you’ve ever had. Period.” </p><p>Braeburn blushed. “Well, Ah stand by what Ah said. It was great.” </p><p>I turned my head around and kissed him on the lips. “Indeed, it was. And thank you again for being so attentive to my needs. I could tell you were pouring your heart into every touch.” </p><p>“Of course, Ah was. As a gentleman, Ah gotta do everythin’ in mah power to make the gal Ah love happy and satisfied. It’s the proper way of things, after all.” </p><p>I rolled over onto my side and embraced him tightly. “Congratulations~ You’ve succeeded.”</p><p>Braeburn rubbed my back. “Good. Ah was a might worried that I’d caught ya off guard with the spontaneity of our—erm—little mornin’ escapade.”</p><p>“To be honest, I’d prefer a little bit more of a warning the next time you decide to get frisky. By all means though, I rather enjoyed getting swept up in the heat of the moment. Your technique certainly seems to have improved from whence we first made love. Easily a solid B+.” </p><p>“Only that? Reckon Ah need to practice pleasurin’ ya a bit more, huh?” </p><p>I traced my fingers along his hairy chest. “Luckily for you, I’m quite diligent when it comes to such matters. Not to worry; we’ll get plenty of practice. With breaks in-between, of course~”</p><p>Everything that I’d said to Braeburn was in jest and not meant to be taken as a serious critique of his love-making skills. To reaffirm that sentiment, he pulled me into an affectionate kiss and we snuggled together for a time. In fact, it was so comfortable on the couch that we almost didn’t want to do anything else. However, our rumbling stomachs and the smell of our unwashed bodies convinced us otherwise. With some reluctance, we got up, took a brief shower together, and ate a light breakfast of scrambled eggs accompanied by two slices of sourdough toast. </p><hr/><p>Don’t get me wrong. Having passionate morning sex on the couch with the man you love is a wonderful experience. But it does present some of its own unique… challenges. Immediately after breakfast, we ventured towards the lobby to see what sort of events were planned for the remainder of the day. We took care to walk around gingerly because our genitals were still quite sore. I had to resist the subconscious urge to massage my aching kitty because that would have been extraordinarily uncouth. Even at a naturist resort. I was a proper lady damn it! There were certain standards that I needed to uphold at all costs, despite my own personal discomfort. </p><p>Braeburn didn’t seem to be faring much better than I was. I happened to glance down towards his waist and noticed that his penis was slightly red and inflamed. Particularly, around the shaft. My cheeks flushed a rosy hue when I realized that it was the direct result of my tightness and milking him so fervently. In the end, I decided not to dwell on Braeburn’s apparent discomfort too much. It took a pair of lovers to perform the horizontal tango and we were both equally responsible for what had transpired earlier this morning. Not that I regretted doing it, mind you.  </p><p>I let out a deep sigh and rubbed Braeburn’s lower back. “For pity’s sake, I’m half-tempted to just sit spread eagle in a chair somewhere and place a giant ice pack atop my lady bits. I can’t even remember the last time I was this sore…” </p><p>Braeburn winced. “Sorry, Rares. Ah feel like it’s partially mah fault fer bein’ so enthusiastic.” </p><p>I kissed his cheek. “There’s no need for such talk, darling. We’re both grown adults and we chose to engage in a consensual activity together. I’m not upset nor do I regret making love to you this morning. I am… simply in need of an aspirin tablet. You as well, by the looks of it.” </p><p>“Reckon Ah do. Gonna be sore fer a while.” Braeburn admittedly bashfully. </p><p>“In that case, I suggest we do something that doesn’t involve much physical activity.”  </p><p>Braeburn glanced over at the resort map. “How about we take a nice soak in the hot tub?” </p><p>I clapped my hands together. “An excellent idea, darling! Hot water should do wonders for the both of us. After that, maybe we could come up with some sort of game plan for the day.” </p><p>As luck would have it, we were literally the only two people in the entire spa. That said, I took full advantage of the situation by locating one of the bubble jets and spreading my legs apart in a most unladylike fashion. To answer your question: no, I wasn’t trying to pleasure myself in a public hot tub. It did feel divine, yes, but it was merely to sooth the dull ache of my sore kitty.  </p><p>I laid my head back on the bath pillow and groaned. “Oh yesssss~ That’s just the right spot.” </p><p>“Heh. Ah take it ya found one of the bubble jets?”</p><p>I cracked open one of my eyes and scoffed. “Yes, if you must know. And you’d best withhold any judgement of my decision, darling. Otherwise, I shan’t hesitate to twist your nipple in a most painful and embarrassing fashion. Have I made myself clear?” </p><p>Braeburn laughed. “No need ta get all bent outta shape, Rares. Ah ain’t judgin’.” </p><p>“Good. You’re a smart man, Braeburn Apple.”</p><p>Braeburn leaned back and closed his eyes. “Only when Ah have ta be.” </p><p>We didn’t say much to one another for a while. There really wasn’t a need to, quite honestly. We simply relaxed and rested our bodies as need be. I will admit that hot tubs are great for a nice soak but one mustn’t stay in them for too long. Not only will the heat start to make you feel lightheaded, it tends to make the skin all wrinkly too. After about twenty minutes, I’d had my fill and the dull, achy soreness in my kitty dissipated. Braeburn appeared to be feeling better as well. </p><p>While we walked through the spa and towards the exit, I couldn’t help but notice that there was someone else using the facility other than the two of us. A woman to be precise. She was in the fitness room doing a few sets of one-handed pushups. I know what you’re thinking: impressive, right? Well, yes… but I mean that in the most literal sense possible. Simply because the woman only had one arm. The other ended in a stump just above where her left elbow was located.</p><p>Other than that, she was the epitome of female athleticism. A lithe, muscular frame, well-toned abdominal muscles, powerfully built legs, and butt cheeks that were so firm you could probably bounce a coin off of them. Her breasts were small and compact, of course, but that was expected of a woman who had so little fat on her body. The woman’s taught, mauve-colored skin glistened with sweat, a testament to how hard she’d been working out.  </p><p>One side of her head was nearly shaved bald whilst the other was grown out just a bit. Sort of in a punk-rocker style, I suppose. The raspberry pink strands seemed to separate out a little due to how damp they were with sweat. She kept her pubic hair styled in a meticulously groomed landing strip. Situated just below that was a silver-studded clitoral piercing. I should also mention that she had a prominent scar along her left eye. Overall, it gave her a rough, almost intimidating appearance. The nude athlete finished her set of pushups, wiped her face off with a white bath towel, and walked over to greet us. </p><p>“Why, if it isn’t Rarity Belle! It’s been a while since I last saw you, kiddo. Welcome back to <i>Cala Concha</i>.”</p><p>“Good morning, Fizzle! How are you doing this fine day?”</p><p>“Not too bad, all things considering. Who’s your hunky friend there?” Fizzle asked.</p><p>“The man standing next to me is Braeburn Apple. We are currently dating. That said, I decided to invite him along on the annual family trip. We were just heading back to the main hall after taking a quick dip in the hot tub. Our… muscles were a bit sore; you see.”</p><p>Braeburn bowed slightly. “Much obliged Miss Fizzle.” </p><p>“You don’t have to act all proper around me, hun. Just call me plain, old Fizzle. I can’t very well have Rarity’s boyfriend treat me like I’m some old school marm. How’s my resort treating you two so far? Good, I hope. Oh—um—sorry if I stink from all the sweaty funk. Just finished up my morning workout routine. Do you mind if I go take a quick shower?” </p><p>I smiled politely. “No worries. Might I say how fabulous you look, darling?”</p><p>“Thanks, Rarity! As you can clearly see, I work hard to keep my body in peak physical condition,” Fizzle explained to Braeburn while we walked towards the shower room, “It’s kind of a habit of mine that carried over from my days in the Marine Corps.”</p><p>I caught Braeburn staring at Captain Berrytwist far more intently than was considered polite. Even by naturist standards. However, I’m not sure if it was just because she possessed the kind of physique that would have made an Olympian jealous or that he simply found Fizzle’s missing appendage unnerving. Personally, I believed she had her own unique charm. When she turned on the faucet and allowed the water to wash away the sweat, Braeburn looked over at me with an uneasy expression. I put my hands on my hips and tapped my foot. </p><p>“So—uhh—that woman’s the owner of the resort?” Braeburn leaned over and whispered in my ear.</p><p>I nodded slowly. “Yes, darling. She also happens to be a close family friend.”</p><p>Fizzle rinsed her hair with shampoo and began lathering up with a soapy bath pouf. “I know you’re probably curious about how I got this way, aren’t ya? C’mon~ There’s no need to feel so shy, Mr. Braeburn. Lots of folks have that reaction the first time they meet me. I’m not upset or anything like that. Do you really want to know? I’d be more than happy to tell you.” </p><p>“Yeah… Ah do. Sorry, Miss. Wasn’t mah intention ta put ya on the spot.” </p><p>Fizzle continued her story, unphased. “It was Rarity’s mom who first introduced me into naturism, you know. Remember it like it was yesterday. I’d just gotten back from a tour in—that’s how I lost my arm and got his sexy scar, by the way. My Humvee ran over an IED.”</p><p>“I’m so sorry fer starin’ at ya earlier. Mah curiosity got the better of me, I’m afraid. Ain’t seen too many folks in your… condition before. Ah had no idea what ya went through.” </p><p>Fizzle grinned. “Hey, don’t sweat it. No harm done. It took me a while to get used to retired life even though the Corps gave me a pretty lavish pension. I’d recovered physically but… I was in bad shape mentally. Had some pretty dark thoughts. Heh. It’s funny, ya know. If you’d have told me that I’d wind up opening a naturist resort back then, I’d have laughed my ass off.”  </p><p>Braeburn shifted uncomfortably. “How’s come? Ya seem pretty comfortable bein’ nude ta me.” </p><p>Fizzle stood under the nozzle and rinsed off all the suds. “I am now. But for the longest time, I shied away from nudity because I thought that my injuries made me look gruesome. Even when I was wearing clothes, I felt like people were disgusted by my appearance. Cookie convinced me otherwise. She said I was still beautiful despite what anyone thought and that my injuries were a badge of honor, a testament to my service.”  </p><p>I smiled. “I’m so glad you decided to give naturism a try, darling. It really suits you.”</p><p>Fizzle wrapped me in a one-armed hug. “Thanks, Rarity. Granted, there are days when I still get a little nervous around strangers, but those instances are becoming less and less frequent. Anyway… do you guys wanna grab a smoothie? I could really use something cold and refreshing to drink right about now.” </p><p>After soaking in a hot tub for a while, a cold drink sounded delightful! With a slight nod, Braeburn grasped my hand and we followed Fizzle out to the café for some much-needed refreshments. The menu was your standard fare for a tropical resort, including but not limited to: virgin piña colada, strawberry kiwi etc. I settled for blueberry vanilla, Braeburn went with classic orange mango, and Fizzle… lemongrass, apple, and banana? Erm—not the most appetizing combination to me personally but some people are into healthier options for their smoothies. </p><p>Fizzle took a seat across from us at one of the tables. They offered a lovely view of the ocean and were situated outdoors. As an added bonus, many of the tables had cute little umbrellas propped up in the center to offer a little shade for guests while they enjoyed their food or in our case, a beverage. Braeburn took full advantage of the seating arrangement and wrapped his free arm around my shoulder while we sipped on our smoothies together. I, in turn, felt that it was fair game to place my hand on his thigh and stroke it affectionately. He smiled and leaned over to kiss me on the cheek. Before I knew it, Fizzle was snickering at us.  </p><p>“What? Is there something wrong?” I asked. </p><p>“Oh, nothing~ You two are just super lovey-dovey is all.” </p><p>We both blushed slightly and I pursed my lips into a sour expression. “Pardon my frankness, darling but you’re just going to have to deal with our proclivities when it comes to PDA. I have gone far too long without finding that special someone to share my life with. I’m certainly not going to waste any chance I get to show Braeburn how much I love him.”</p><p>Fizzle waved her stump in a placating manner. “Woah! Easy, Rarity. There’s no need to get your non-existent panties in a twist. I think you guys look adorable together. Really! I’m happy for the both of you. What I said was just a harmless joke. So—uh—are we still cool?”</p><p>I blushed even harder when I realized that she was just teasing me. “Erm—well, alright. I’m sorry, dear. Sometimes, it’s difficult for me to handle criticism. Even in jest….” </p><p>An inevitable bout of awkward silence stretched between the three of us for quite some time. I know she was just kidding but I think Fizzle genuinely felt bad about teasing us. I also got the impression (<i>Mother knew her far better than me</i>) that she felt jealous of our relationship too. Not so much in words, but by the slightly pained expression and deep sigh she let out afterwards. </p><p>Damn it! I didn’t realize that Fizzle was so self-conscious about being single. By all accounts, it seemed to me like she was brimming with confidence. However, one must take into account that the market for female combat veteran amputees (<i>not to mention naturists</i>) isn’t exactly broad. Don’t get me wrong; I believe that Fizzle is the best family friend anyone could possibly ask for and always has been. She just comes off as a bit intimidating to <s>most</s> some people. </p><p>Despite knowing Fizzle as well as I do, her physical appearance combined with her outspoken personality, more often than not, tended to make strangers feel uncomfortable. At least, initially. I really wish people wouldn’t be so skittish around her but even amongst naturists, there are times when we judge a book at face value. It is a core tenant of human nature, unfortunately.  </p><p>Unable to bear the painfully awkward silence any longer, I got up out of my seat and carefully placed my hands on her shoulders. My goodness! I could feel the layers of taught muscle wound tightly just underneath her bare skin, but I gave her a comforting massage to the best of my ability regardless. Braeburn even seemed to pick up on her discomfort. Not… that it was in any way difficult to miss. Fizzle always wore her emotions on her—ah—sleeves, so to speak. </p><p>The vet sighed, took a big slurp of her smoothie, and fiddled with the straw. “I’m sorry for being such a wet blanket, guys. I didn’t mean to make our little get-together super awkward or anything. It’s just that seeing you two act all lovey-dovey with each other made me realize how much it sucks to be single at a place like this. Let’s face it: I’m not exactly what anyone would call a spring chicken anymore. I just turned thirty-five a month ago!!”  </p><p>I gently rubbed Fizzle’s back while she continued to vent. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught Braeburn’s astonished expression while he was taking another swig of his smoothie. I don’t think he was aware of how old Fizzle truly was. Quite frankly, she didn’t look like someone in their mid-thirties to me. Of course, it helped that she kept her body in such fantastic shape. As I said before, she could have easily passed as a professional athlete if one knew nothing else about her. </p><p>Come to think of it, (<i>you’ll have to excuse me for stealing one of Applejack’s famous countryisms</i>) I wasn’t entirely certain which way her barn door swung myself. Fizzle had never given any clear indication as to what sort of preferences she had concerning romantic partners. Mother never mentioned the subject before either. Did Fizzle even have a type? Well, I suppose she must or—for goodness sake, I can’t believe I’m agonizing over this! What should I say? </p><p>I closed my eyes and let out a deep breath. “Fizzle, my dear. I understand how frustrating it can be to find the right romantic partner. To be perfectly honestly, it took several years for Braeburn and I to finally reconnect and begin our relationship together in earnest. I’m… sure you’ll find someone. You just have to be patient, keep a positive attitude, and put yourself out there.” </p><p>“Yeah, of course. Ok then! Let’s move on, shall we? So—um—what do you guys wanna do next? I’m pretty much game for whatever. If I’m not mistaken, I believe Cream Heart is hosting a baking class in the Recreation Center right about now. Does that sound like fun?” </p><p>I scrunched my brow in confusion. “Pardon my ignorance, but who is Cream Heart?” </p><p>Fizzle slapped her forehead. “Oh, shit! Sorry, Rarity. I forgot to mention that she’s the one in charge of creating all of the delicious baked goodies around here. Her son stays with her at the resort during the summer free of charge. Had to give her some kind of employee perk, right?”</p><p>“I take it they’re both naturists, then?” </p><p>Fizzle finished her smoothie and nodded. “Yep. Lifelong too. It pretty much goes without saying that enticing professionals to come work at a naturist resort who aren’t accustomed to the lifestyle is an uphill battle at best. Don’t worry; I pay her quite handsomely. She and her son don’t exactly live around here, so that’s why she only works for me during the summer.”  </p><p>Braeburn didn’t seem to have any objections, so I clapped my hands. “Very well, then. I think a nude baking class could be quite fun~ It’s been ages since I last made any sort of pastry.”</p><hr/><p>While we walked together towards the Recreation Center, I couldn’t help but notice a familiar face along the way. Erm—well, not so much a face but a backside and far more than I cared to ever see. For whatever reason, Trenderhoof had decided to visit <i>Cala Concha</i> and he was crawling on his knees with his bottom pointed straight into the air. It’s rather difficult to ignore a man’s testicles when they’re dangling about like a sack of artisan cheese hanging from a hook. I really shouldn’t stare but—they were most definitely waxed. There wasn’t a single hair to be found anywhere. UGH! Glistening too. I’ll bet he must’ve rubbed Vaseline all over them.  </p><p>He was taking photographs apparently, but I failed to see why he couldn’t just do that while standing on his own two feet. I looked back at Braeburn and Fizzle, pleading to them with my eyes for us to just mind our own business and simply move on. However, it was not to be. Trenderhoof chose that very moment to get up and turn around. He even smiled at me. </p><p>“Oh! Hello there, Rarity. Fancy meeting you here. What are the odds?” </p><p>I forced my lips to turn upward into a polite smile while I shook his hand. At least he was maintaining eye contact. “Likewise, darling. Are you here for business or pleasure?”</p><p>Trenderhoof held up his camera. “Mostly business. After reading about your little speech from the Gala, I decided to give this whole naturism thing a try. Kudos by the way. That was a pretty bold move you made there. Everyone’s raving about your awesome body paint showcase.” </p><p>“Ah. Is that so? Well, I’m glad that I was able to make a small contribution towards everyone’s understanding of naturism and body positivity in general. Are you enjoying your stay thus far?” </p><p>Trenderhoof jabbed his thumb towards his chest. “You bet! I didn’t realize how good it felt to just let it all hang out, ya know? When I first arrived, the staff at the spa even offered to give me a full Brazilian wax on the house. Isn’t that great?! I’m smoother than a baby’s bottom. Ha!” </p><p>“Umm… yes, I noticed.” </p><p>Thankfully, Fizzle decided to walk in front of me and offer a friendly handshake to Trenderhoof before the dreadful awkwardness could continue. “G’day! My name’s Fizzle. You must be that magazine reviewer from—uhh—sorry, I can’t seem to remember the name.”</p><p>Against all odds, a bashful smile spread across Trenderhoof’s face. Not only that, but he actually blushed! “Trendy-Scene Magazine, Ma’am. You must be <i>Cala Concha</i>’s illustrious owner! I must say, I’ve really been enjoying my stay here so far. The food, the accommodations, and especially <i>the views</i> are all spectacular. Major props~”</p><p>Fizzle smiled. “Thanks. I poured my heart and soul into making <i>Cala Concha</i> the best naturist resort anyone could possibly ask for. Honestly though, most of the credit should go to my staff. Without them, this entire operation wouldn’t be half as successful.” </p><p>“Well, I’m sure everyone appreciates all of your hard work as much as I do.”</p><p>“Braeburn,” I whispered into his ear, “Am I seeing what I think I’m seeing?”  </p><p>“Maybe? That fella sure does like ta keep himself tided up. He’s all shiny too. How’s come—” </p><p>“Vaseline, darling. It keeps one’s skin silky smooth and helps retain moisture. But enough about that! Did you see the way he looked at Fizzle? I’m almost positive he’s got a thing for her.”</p><p>Braeburn scratched his head. “Uh… what makes ya think that?”  </p><p>“Just look at him! He’s blushing up a storm. Trenderhoof only does that when he’s nervous around a woman he fancies. I can’t honestly tell if this is a good thing or not.” </p><p>Braeburn shrugged. “You’d know better than me, Rares. Seein’ as how you’ve known the two of ‘em longer than Ah have. Ah mean, if they’re both willin’ ta give datin’ a try, what’s the harm?”</p><p>I had to resist the urge to roll my eyes when I witnessed Fizzle twirl a strand of her hair and giggle. It was surprisingly girlish and cute. How …unexpected? I immediately recognized her intent. As a woman myself, I could tell that she desired to learn more about Trenderhoof, perhaps even to the point of considering him as a potential suitor. She was blushing too! Oh, for pity’s sake! Why on earth did she have to be interested in <i>HIM</i> of all people? Why?!! </p><p>“That’s exactly my point, darling. Trenderhoof hasn’t exactly been… the most outstanding character. Or at least, he wasn’t when I first met him back in college. Maybe I’m not giving him a fair chance. He seemed to have turned over a new leaf when we last met in the park.”</p><p>Braeburn patted my shoulder. “See? There’s yer answer. Ain’t no reason ta get all bent outta shape, Rares. They’re grown adults and they’re allowed ta make their own mistakes.” </p><p>I crossed my arms underneath my breasts and huffed. “Well, it’s not as though I can expressly forbid the two of them from getting to know each other better. But! I reserve the right to kick Trenderhoof’s shiny ball sack into next week if he mistreats Fizzle in any way whatsoever.”  </p><p>Braeburn chuckled. “Totally with ya there, hun. Like Ah said: just let things play out organically and see what happens. Who knows? Maybe they’re exactly what the other needs right now.” </p><p>I glanced over at Fizzle. She was probably laughing at some asinine joke Trenderhoof had told her. Damn it all! They really did seem to be ‘<i>clicking</i>’ as it were. Against my better judgment, I decided against telling her about Trenderhoof’s sordid past with me. Fizzle could find out about that straight from the horse’s mouth. That is, assuming that he had truly become a changed man as he claimed. Seeing as how they weren’t going to stop on their own, I walked in front of them, cleared my throat in an exaggerated manner, and stomped my feet on the ground to get their attention. Was it a bit immature of me? Yes, I suppose it was. But it had the desired effect. </p><p>Fizzle chuckled bashfully. “Oh! Sorry, Rarity. I got a bit carried away chatting with Trender.”</p><p>I cocked my brow. “So, it would seem. Braeburn and I are still interested in attending the baking class later on. Are planning on coming with us or has your itinerary changed?” </p><p>Fizzled shuffled her feet. “Could I possibly get a raincheck for that?”</p><p>“I don’t see any harm in it. What do you intend to do instead?” </p><p>Trenderhoof held up his hand. “If I may interject for a moment…” </p><p>I didn’t even bother responding to him verbally. I simply narrowed my eyes. </p><p>“Hey! What’s the stink eye for? I’m not trying to be a creep! Look, I’m not asking you to forgive me for what I did to you back in college, but could you at least give me one chance to prove that I’m not the same person I was back then? Please. I’m begging you! Just this once…”</p><p>I pulled Trenderhoof aside and waved my finger at him. “In the spirit of fairness, I shall give you <b>ONE</b> chance. Given Fizzle’s… physical appearance, anyone can see that she’s been through some very trying circumstances as a veteran. She’s suffered mentally too. In layman terms, it means that her confidence as a woman is quite fragile right now.”</p><p>“Uh… really? That’s not the impression I got. What? Do you really think that I’d make fun of Fizzle because of her battle wounds? Rest assured, nothing about that handsomely sculpted, muscular physique of hers bothers me whatsoever. Mmmm~ In fact, I think it serves to further enhance the whole badass amazon warrior vibe she’s got going on.”</p><p>I rubbed the bridge of my nose and groaned. “You’ve got a thing for strong women, don’t you?” </p><p>Trenderhoof blushed but nodded in agreement. “Mhmm. That’s for sure. Well, and… the fact that she’s completely naked is, like, a major turn-on for me too. Oooooh~ Look at all those <i>GLORIOUS</i> muscles! I can’t wait to see what they fe—”</p><p>I slipped my hand in-between his legs and grabbed hold of his testicles. Then, I began to squeeze them just hard enough to cause some discomfort. “I’m happy to hear that you’re genuinely attracted to Fizzle, but… keep your libido in check or <b>I WILL DESTROY YOU</b>. Got it?”</p><p>“Perfectly clear,” Trenderhoof responded in a pained voice, “can you pleassssse let go of my balls now, Rarity? They’re an essential piece of equip—OW!”</p><p>“Just wanted to make sure you and I were on the same page, darling.” I whispered venomously. </p><p>As soon as I released his Vaseline-coated ballsack from my grasp, Trenderhoof awkwardly waddled back over to Fizzle so that he could continue his conversation with her. I felt just a tiny bit guilty for letting my temper get the best of me but there was absolutely no way that he misinterpreted my declaration. Not a threat, darling. A promise. With that matter resolved, I joined Braeburn once more, kissed him on the cheek, and looped my arm around his. </p><p>Fizzle rubbed the end of her stump (<i>a nervous habit of hers</i>) and cleared her throat. “Like I was saying earlier, since this is my day off, I’d like to spend some more time with Trender—uh—discussing his magazine article on <i>Cala Concha</i>… and other stuff. Is that ok with you guys?”  </p><p>I chuckled. “I don’t suppose this involves wine and a romantic dinner by the seaside?” </p><p>Fizzle blushed furiously despite her dark complexion. “So, what if it does? You’ve already got yourself a hot boyfriend, Rarity. Cut me a little slack here…” </p><p>“Oh, my goodness~ It seems the attraction, against all odds, must be mutual between the two of you. Alright. Who am I to deny you, Fizzle? Have fun and remember to pace yourselves.”</p><p>We watched as the unlikely pair scampered off towards the beach. I highly doubt they were ever going to discuss any magazine publications, but Fizzle deserved to relax and just hang loose for a while. I’m not really sure what she saw in Trenderhoof. Perhaps, it was simply because he accepted her so readily? I mean, it’s not as though he was ugly but—whatever. I’m not going to work myself into a paranoid stupor thinking about what could happen between them. Braeburn and I had a baking class to attend.</p>
