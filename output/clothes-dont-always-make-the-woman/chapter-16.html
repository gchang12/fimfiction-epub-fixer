		<h1>Barbeque At My Bestie&#039;s House</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 16</b></p><p>Rarity’s Apartment, Manehattan </p><p>After letting out a loud yawn, I cracked open my eyes and stretched out languidly from underneath the bed sheets. There was no denying it; I was utterly exhausted from the rescue attempt last night and my entire body felt sore. In particular, pain radiated along both sides of my ribcage when I inhaled too deeply. I shuffled over to the vanity mirror and gave myself a quick look over. My skin was covered with a smattering of nasty, purple-brown bruises. I sighed as I raised my arms and turned around to view my backside. No amount of makeup would be able to conceal my injuries from Sweetie, and wearing clothes would only arouse her suspicion further. </p><p>I had a decision to make. She already knew about the abilities the geode had given me. What harm would there be if I told her about the opal that had fused with my body in Equestria, and the subsequent powers that came with it? I bit my lip. There was a very real danger that if my identity were to be revealed somehow, unscrupulous characters would try to kidnap her again or worse. I closed my eyes for a moment and steeled my resolve. In this situation, honesty was the best policy. I just hoped that she would have enough sense to be discreet about my alter ego. </p><p>A quick glance at the clock told me that I’d slept in rather late. Unsurprising, considering how late we’d been out last night… or morning, I should say. It was a little past noon. I suppose I could whip up some light fare for lunch or order takeout. But coffee was a must, regardless of the hour. The caffeine would help soothe my growing headache and make me more alert for the serious discussion that lies ahead. When I walked out to the kitchenette, a bedraggled and nude Sweetie Belle was already brewing a pot of caramel-mocha coffee. Bless her heart! I approached her cautiously, since I knew that she was still frazzled from her harrowing ordeal. </p><p>“Good afternoon, dear. Did you manage to get any sleep?” I asked.</p><p>My baby sister turned around and yawned. Her eyes had dark circles underneath them and were thoroughly bloodshot. The poor thing. “Nope. There’s no point trying to go back to bed either.” </p><p>I wrapped my arms around her waist, pulled her close to me, and kissed the back of her head as I breathed in her scent. “I’m so sorry you had to go through all that. Oh, Sweetie! You can’t imagine how relieved I am that you’re safe and unharmed. I was worried sick about you.” </p><p>“Thanks, Rarity.” Sweetie replied softly, her voice on the verge of cracking. </p><p>When she turned around to look at me, tears were rolling down her cheeks. “Would you like a tissue? Here, let me grab you one. Feel free to say or do whatever you wish. Let it all out.” </p><p>After a few wet snuffles, she shuffled her feet. “The worst of it is over now, I guess. I dunno what to do about this whole situation. Rara texted me earlier and said I could take off for as long as I needed but… it just doesn’t feel right. I should be doing something productive with my time instead of moping around your apartment all day. What do you think?” </p><p>“I suppose working could help you adjust and move on. Might I make a suggestion?”</p><p>“Sure. That’s why I asked in the first place.” </p><p>I placed my hands on her shoulders. “At the very least, take a day or two off and rest. That way, when you go back to the studio, you’ll be recharged and ready to give Rara your best. Now, why don’t we enjoy a cup of coffee, then take a bath together. It’ll do us both a world of good.” </p><p>Sweetie rubbed her arm and blushed slightly. “Are you sure? We haven’t done that in years.”</p><p>“Come now, Sweetie. What is there to be embarrassed about? There isn’t a nook or cranny of our bodies that we haven’t seen before already. Consider it sisterly bonding time.”  </p><p>Sweetie took a swig of coffee. “Sorry, it’s just that… I’m used to taking showers all by myself. The last time we took a bath together was like forever ago! Are you sure it won’t get weird?”</p><p>I smiled, reminiscing back to our childhood. “When we were still living together at Mother &amp; Father’s house, as I recall. And no, I don’t believe it will, darling. To be quite honest, I could use some companionship right now. Don’t get me wrong; Extravagance is a wonderful dog and loyal friend, but he can never fill in as a substitute for another human being.”</p><p>Sweetie tapped her fingers along the edge of the mug. “Sounds like you miss your boyfriend.” </p><p>“Indeed. I wish Braeburn were here right now, but he has responsibilities elsewhere. I suppose that’s just part of being involved in a romantic relationship with someone. You must accept your partner for who and what they are. Even if it means being away from them for a while.” </p><p>Sweetie padded over the balcony and looked out the window towards the Manehattan skyline. The view was one of the reasons I chose this apartment in the first place. “Is he cool with you being a naturist? With Button, it’s a little different since he’s already familiar with the lifestyle.” </p><p>“I’m not entirely certain if he’ll ever come to embrace naturism with the same gusto as we have, darling. At the very least, he appears to tolerate my habits. It makes me wonder what kind of arrangements we’d need to make, if we decide to live with each other on a permanent basis.” </p><p>“Are you gonna marry him? Sounds like you’ve got a pretty serious relationship to me.” </p><p>I nearly choked on my coffee. “I—erm—don’t quite have an answer to that yet. It wouldn’t surprise me if Braeburn proposed sooner rather than later. He is the chivalrous type, after all.” </p><p>Sweetie giggled. “Awww! That’s so romantic.” </p><p>“All right. Enough gossiping about my love life. Time for a bath!”  </p><p>Extravagance begged me to let him into the bathroom with us, but I had to put my foot down and tell him no. Don’t feel too bad for him. I bribed the little bulldog with a cup full of his favorite peanut butter flavored canine ice cream. That would keep him content for a little while at least. With that problem solved, I proceeded to fill the tub with hot water and squirted some scented bubble bath oil near the faucet so that it could mix properly. In no time at all, we practically had ourselves a private jacuzzi. Rest assured the tub was more than large enough to accommodate us both. I like to be able to stretch my legs out when taking baths. </p><p>I slipped in first, followed close behind by Sweetie. An unconscious moan escaped my lips as the hot water enveloped my skin. It helped to soothe all the sore spots. Before I could begin scrubbing in earnest, I felt Sweetie do it for me. It was a touching gesture and I appreciated how gentle she was being. The peaceful atmosphere was destined to end soon, as I’m sure she noticed the bruises. I took in as deep a breath as I was able and blew it out slowly through my nose. </p><p>“There’s no use in trying to hide it. I’m pretty sure I know where those bruises came from.” </p><p>I chuckled awkwardly. “Ah. So… you noticed them.” </p><p>“Kind of hard to miss with your complexion, Rarity. Speaking of, I had my suspicions last night but seeing your skin like this has erased all doubt from my mind. You were that crazy naked lady in the mask who fought all the mercenaries! Don’t try to lie. I’d know your body anywhere.” </p><p>I looked down at the water. “I’d appreciate it if you didn’t refer to me as crazy, darling. Very well. I admit that it was me who saved both you and Rara last night.”</p><p>“More like completely stupid! You could have gotten killed!” Sweetie squeaked. </p><p>I went on to explain what had happened with the opal, Equestria, and my subsequent return home. Throughout my explanation, Sweetie seemed to take everything in stride, but her serious expression never changed. Before long, I heard a loud slosh as she leaned back against the edge of the tub and spread her legs out. In response, I turned around and did the same so that I could meet her face to face instead of having to crane my neck. Sweetie lifted her foot out of the water and wiggled her toes, apparently lost in thought. I sat quietly, unsure what else to say. </p><p>“Even with all those cool gem powers, you’ll need more training if you want to become a proper crime-fighting super heroine. I love that you don’t need to wear a costume though! Beyond the mask, of course. Because that’s important. You can’t have people figuring out your identity.”  </p><p>I twiddled my fingers. “I didn’t see the need as my own skin provides far more protection than any outfit on the market, black or otherwise.  To answer your other question, I don’t intend to become a full-time vigilante. That’s what the MMPD is for, darling. I prefer leading a normal, mundane life as Rarity, the jewelry maker instead. Even if I happen to possess super powers.” </p><p>Sweetie pouted by crossing her arms underneath her breasts. “But you’ve already built up some street cred! Your picture’s been plastered all over the internet by now. The video Rara took has gone viral too. Um—I think it’s probably because you’re a strong, courageous heroine bringing hope to the city of Manehattan… or that you’re some crazy naked chick letting it all hang out while fighting crime. What? Most people think you’re hot, Rarity. Take it as a compliment! I-I mean, you’ve always been pretty so—I’ll just shut up now and let you watch the video.” </p><p>Sure enough, when Sweetie handed me her phone and showed me the uncensored version of the video in question, it displayed my body in compromising (<i>combat)</i> positions where nothing was left to the imagination. I blushed furiously as I read some of the lewd comments posted, but none seemed to criticize my actions. More than a few were encouraging, saying that I was brave for rescuing hostages in a situation where the MMPD had failed to react quickly enough. In that vein, the MMPD’s chief had apparently taken a lot of heat from the media, causing the entire department significant embarrassment, as they’d allowed a nude vigilante to do their job. </p><p>Still blushing, I cleared my throat. “My goodness! I hadn’t realized the extent of my popularity.” </p><p>Sweetie rolled her eyes. “You really need to pay more attention to that kind of stuff! That’s how the world works nowadays. Anyway, you’re basically internet famous, so I should probably set up a fan page for you. Who knows? You might even get donations from time to time.”</p><p>I rubbed my temples, feeling a headache coming on. “Sweetie, this isn’t a popularity contest. If I had my way, I’d sooner hang up the mask for good and forget that last night ever happened.”</p><p>“But think of all the good you can do!” Sweetie protested. </p><p>“I’d rather craft jewelry and leave crime-fighting to the professionals.”  </p><p>In a display of ladylike composure, my little sister of sixteen, splashed her fists in the water, spraying some at my face in the process. Wet and annoyed, I narrowed my eyes. Her expression softened after a few moments, and then she began to cry. “Don’t you know how jealous I am of your magic super powers? You get to do amazing things, and I’m stuck being a dumb teenager!”</p><p>I scooched forward and cupped her cheeks in the palms of my hands. “You’re anything but dumb, Sweetie. There are plenty of things you’re talented at: like singing and computer programming for instance. I know this is difficult for someone your age to understand, but having super powers is not all fun and games. They are meant to be used responsibly, not for personal gain. My main concern with going down the path of vigilantism is that I might endanger those I love. I don’t want to take any unnecessary risks if I’m in a position to mitigate them.”</p><p>Sweetie’s entire body sagged while she processed my response. “I’m sorry for acting like a spoiled brat. You’re right. I didn’t think about all the other stuff that might happen if you put yourself in harm’s way. It seems like you’re wasting your abilities if you don’t help out people who could use a super-heroine in their lives. I know it sounds silly, but that’s how I feel.” </p><p>I hugged my sister close to me while I ran my fingers through her curly locks. She hiccupped a few times, sniffed, and nuzzled her cheek against my breast. “I can’t say that I understand what you mean completely, but I respect your point of view. Besides, you’re sorting through a great deal of trauma and stress right now. I dare say, you’re expected to be a little emotional.”</p><p>We embraced each other for a little while longer, until Sweetie was finally able to calm down. It was impossible for me to be upset with her because she was just a teenager, going through a difficult time. Raging hormones, changes to one’s body, and unpredictable mood swings were challenging enough but to have to deal with being kidnapped was more than anyone should ever have to bear. I exited the tub first, and began to towel off, as I didn’t want to become a giant pearly white prune. Sweetie followed suit shortly thereafter, and began to blow dry her hair.  </p><p>While going about my daily skin care regimen in the living room, I happened to notice that my phone was vibrating on the kitchen table. Since my body was still a bit sore from the fight, moving gracefully wasn’t an option, so I ended up awkwardly hobbling over to the table to answer the call. As a precaution, I typically kept the video function turned off. It was more for the sake of my clients rather than my friends, as they knew about my preferences regarding attire. </p><p>I glanced down at the screen and saw a name pop up that I hadn’t been expecting. It was none other than Sunset Shimmer. Curious. “Good afternoon, darling. To what do I owe the pleasure?” </p><p>“Hey, Rarity. Flash &amp; I were wondering if you’d like to come over to our house for a BBQ.”</p><p>Realizing that I hadn’t eaten anything yet, my stomach grumbled at the prospect of cooked meat. “That sounds wonderful. However, it may take me a while to arrive.” </p><p>“Not a problem,” Sunset replied, “Oh, and your sister is welcome to come along too.” </p><p>I twirled a strand of my hair as I looked out the window. “I’d have to ask if she’s interested. Sweetie… has gone through a harrowing ordeal recently. I’m not sure if she’ll be up to traveling anywhere today. It shall take time for her to completely get over the trauma, I’m afraid.” </p><p>“I heard about the kidnapping on the news. Um—we’ve got a swimming pool in the backyard. Sweetie can go swimming with us or—you know—just chill if she decides to come along. Teenagers love free food and being lazy, right? The best part is: our backyard offers complete privacy from any nosy, peeping neighbors! One of the perks of living near the woods.”</p><p>I chuckled. “I imagine the two of you have taken advantage of said privacy on numerous occasions. Oh ho~ As married couples are often wont to do.”  </p><p>Somehow, I could tell that Sunset was blushing. She let out an awkward cough. “That’s not really any of your business, but… we have, if you must know. <b>ANYWAY</b>! What I’m saying is that you guys don’t have to worry about bringing along bathing suits.”</p><p>“Oh? Am I to assume this BBQ of yours has a <i>casual</i> dress code in place?” </p><p>Sunset giggled. “Sure does! I’m dressed for success right now, in fact. Just ask my husband. He’s certainly enjoying the outfit I picked out this morning. A timeless classic that never goes out of style. One could even go so far as to say it takes the <i>barest</i> amount of effort to slip on~”</p><p>“Excellent! I think a bit of fresh air will do us both a world of good right now.” </p><hr/><p>The hour-long drive to Sunset’s suburban home was a pleasant one. Albeit, not one that I would make on a daily basis. Sweetie and I threw on a pair of rather plain dresses and sandals, as we wanted to wear something easy to slip in and out of once we arrived. It goes without saying that we didn’t bother with undergarments. I hadn’t gotten a chance to get a good look at their home the last time I had visited due to the urgency of the situation. It was a quaint, spacious, single-floored ranch house. Harkening back to the days when Canterlot was experiencing a development boom, and demand for homes was high. I will say this much: the location was nestled up against a forest, offering privacy from prying eyes like Sunset had mentioned.  </p><p>Instead of entering through the front door, Sunset instructed us to go around back via text. Hedges had been planted along the perimeter of the house, acting as a natural fence. There was one spot that had been trimmed into the shape of an arch, along with a corresponding metal gate spanning across the bottom portion. We waited for a few moments, and sure enough, Sunset arrived to unlock it for us. She wore nothing, save for a pair of black sunglasses perched upon her brow as she beckoned us to follow her towards the pool. </p><p>Some light jazz was playing from somewhere within the house, or a portable music device. Flash stood by the grill, cooking up hamburgers and chicken breasts. He wore a gaudy red apron that featured a cartoonish sausage printed on the front dressed in what appeared to be a tuxedo, holding up a suppressed pistol. Just below it, the phrase: “<i>License to Grill</i>” was printed in bold text. He waved to us as we walked by. </p><p>I groaned at the terrible pun. Sunset &amp; Flash were a couple who loved to buy each other corny gifts. It was adorable, I admit, but still cringe-worthy. What surprised me most was that Flash went commando underneath the apron. Like my own paramour, Flash Sentry hadn’t been raised in a naturist household (<i>or a land full of pastel ponies</i>), but found himself in a relationship with someone who preferred to live <i>au naturel</i> whenever possible. In that regard, a few of Sunset’s habits had managed to rub off on him over the years. It made me wonder if Braeburn would ever reach that level of comfort around me. Our trip to the beach together had shown promise.   </p><p>Sunset clapped her hands, then rubbed them together. “Welcome to <i>Casa Del Sunset</i>! Feel free to get comfortable and wear as much or as little as you prefer. Drinks are in the cooler over by the table. Lunch should be ready shortly. It—uh—would have been ready sooner but we got a little distracted. <b>NOT TO WORRY</b>! There’s a bowl full of shrimp cocktail if you’re hungry.” </p><p>It wasn’t obvious if one weren’t looking closely, but Sunset’s amber skin was flushed a shade of rosy pink and glistened with sweat in the afternoon sun. Easily attributable to spending time outdoors in the nude. However, while I was removing my sandals, it occurred to me that her gait was slightly off… as though she was feeling a bit sore. Those horndogs! They’d snuck in a quick shag before we arrived. Judging by the errant blades of grass that were stuck to Sunset’s derriere, I’d wager that they’d done so right in the middle of the backyard. While I pulled the sundress over my head and neatly folded it in a pile by my sandals, I giggled to myself. </p><p>Upon sampling the shrimp cocktail, I tapped Sunset’s shoulder. “Pardon me, darling. Would you happen to have any sunscreen? Sweetie and I have delicate complexions that are prone to sunburn. Even underneath the shade of these lovely trees. I’d rather not take the chance.” </p><p>Sunset chuckled awkwardly. “Shit! That’s right. Gimme a sec and I’ll be right back with some.” </p><p>Sweetie joined me by the table and leaned over to whisper in my ear. “Is it just me or does your friend smell kinda funky? I didn’t wanna say anything ‘cause it’s rude but…”</p><p>“Ah, so you noticed it too. I suspect that she and her husband engaged in some rather… vigorous marital activities just before we arrived. In her haste, I don’t believe Sunset remembered to freshen up afterwards. Just a theory though. For all I know, they could have been out on a jog.” </p><p>Sweetie blushed and cleared her throat. “Oh. Should we, like, tell her?”</p><p>“Hmm. It would be rather gauche to do so, but I know I wouldn’t want to walk around smelling like sweaty sex all day. Especially in the company of friends. I’ll handle it, dear. You run along and enjoy the pool or just lounge on one of the chairs. Whatever suits your fancy.”</p><p>With that, my little sister scampered off and proceeded to cannonball into the pool. Thankfully, Flash didn’t seem to mind the water splashing all over the place, as he was far enough away. I rolled my eyes. I hadn’t meant for her to just jump right in. She needed sunscreen first! Now, it would be far more difficult to apply on her skin unless she dried off with a towel first. In any case, I patiently waited for Sunset to return, which seemed to take longer than expected. </p><p>When she finally showed up with a bottle of sunscreen in hand, I noticed that her hair was wet and she smelled of shampoo. Strawberry-Mango, I believe. The scent suited her. Apparently, she had realized her faux pas and took a quick shower to rectify her body odor issue. I smiled politely, and took the sunscreen. Seeing no point in sitting down, I squirted some in my hand and began rubbing it all over my skin. And yes, I mean in every nook and cranny. Thankfully, Sunset took it upon herself to help me with my back and shoulders, as any good friend would do. </p><p>Voice barely above a whisper, Sunset spoke to me while I lathered up my breasts and stomach with a healthy dollop of sunscreen. “Sorry about earlier, Rarity. We got caught up in the heat of the moment and lost track of time. When I realized that you two were almost here, I had to think on my feet. Hence, my—erm—slightly disheveled state.” </p><p>“It’s quite alright, darling. I might’ve been tempted to do the same with Braeburn.”</p><p>Sunset frowned sympathetically. “I take it you don’t get to see him very much…” </p><p>I shook my head. “Unfortunately, no. Our schedules vary and he stays with his relatives in Appleloosa during the harvest season to cut down on commuting. The last time we were together was during our vacation at <i>Cala Concha</i>. With all the other drama going on in my life right now, I haven’t had much time to focus on our relationship. Does that make me a bad partner?” </p><p>Sunset patted my back affectionately. “Let’s just say that you’ve had to deal with some pretty unique circumstances. I’m sure he still loves you, Rares. No need to beat yourself up.” </p><p>I sighed. “Very well. I suppose there’s no sense in dwelling on matters out of my control.”</p><p>One thoroughly soaked Sweetie Belle plodded over to where we were conversing with a sheepish expression spread across her lips. “I’m ready for some sunscreen, girls! On the bright side, the water is cool and refreshing. 10/10 would recommend going for a swim.” </p><p>“Not like that you aren’t,” I admonished, “go find a towel and dry off first, young lady. Unless you’d prefer looking like Strawberry Belle for the remainder of the day.”</p><p>“But I don’t see any towels around here…” </p><p>Sunset laughed. “Yet another thing we forgot to bring out. Why don’t you go ask Flash?”</p><p>My sister shrugged and walked over to Flash, who had just finished cooking up the meat. They entered the house, presumably, to fetch some towels and clean up. Or at least in Flash’s case. In the meantime, Sunset and I decided to lounge on a pair of the chairs by the pool, enjoying the sun as it warmed our skin. It felt marvelous. There was nothing quite like experiencing the outdoors as mother nature intended. </p><p>I very nearly dozed off, until Sweetie came back and poked my side, in an effort to get my attention. Slightly annoyed at the pain it had caused, I rose from the chair slowly and narrowed my eyes at her. Realizing her mistake, Sweetie offered her hand, which I took graciously. </p><p>“Sorry, my bad. I forgot about your injuries. The good news is: I was able to put on sunscreen! Sunset’s husband was kind enough to help me coat all the hard-to-reach spots after he cleaned up in the bathroom. Flash seems like a pretty cool guy and he’s not bad looking either.”  </p><p>“No offense taken, dear. Let’s get something to eat then. I’m famished.” </p><p>Sunset was happily munching away at her hamburger, stuffed to the brim with lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, and other condiments. She’d already managed to smear ketchup and mustard all over her face but I said nothing. It struck me as odd that a former Equestrian would enjoy consuming meat so much, but then again, she was no longer a unicorn. I’d have to ask her about it later. The grilled chicken, in particular, looked delicious, so I helped myself to a few pieces and a dollop of potato salad. Sweetie went straight for the hamburger, loading it with bacon, cheese, mushrooms, and BBQ sauce. That was no surprise. My little sister had always been somewhat of a carnivore. </p><p>This was the first time I’d ever seen Flash Sentry in the nude before. He was a handsome fellow just like Sweetie had mentioned; a moderately muscular build, broad shoulders, and smooth yellow skin. He kept his sapphire blue hair well-groomed. It was a cut significantly shorter than it had been during our days at Canterlot High as classmates. Not quite as spikey either. The same could be said of the fuzzy tuft that adorned his manhood. Not that I’m implying it had been a tangled mess back in high school but… you know what I mean! </p><p>When it comes to genitals, I try not to stare as it’s considered impolite. Even by naturist standards. However, as a jewelry maker, I’ve always had a keen eye for detail. At a glance, Sunset’s drunken admission from before seemed a tad exaggerated in my opinion. His penis was slightly above average in terms of length and girth (<i>I’d seen enough in my lifetime to be a good judge of such criteria</i>). Circumcised by the looks of it. The head was bulbous like a mushroom. </p><p>A fine specimen of the male organ, I dare say. Certainly nothing to complain about in terms of size and shape. Not that I judged a man solely on those criteria, mind you! Still, what Sunset had said before vexed me. I could only assume that the former unicorn might have been comparing Flash’s penis to those of stallions in her world? I was no animal expert, but it was common knowledge that stallions were well-endowed. Perhaps, the same applied to Equestrian males.  </p><p>While I took a small bite of potato salad, Flash crouched on his haunches in order to turn off the grill’s propane tank. This, of course, made his testicles dangle freely in the space between his legs. I nearly choked when I realized how big they were (<i>it was rather warm outside and he hadn’t gone for a swim</i> <i>yet</i>) and that they were entirely free of hair. As in… waxed? What a novel concept~ Men typically did not go to such lengths in terms of pubic grooming.  </p><p>I leaned over and whispered into Sunset’s ear discreetly. “Does your husband enjoy tidying up?” </p><p>Sunset’s eyes widened like saucers. “Uh… why do you ask?” </p><p>“Forgive me, darling. I couldn’t help but notice how incredibly smooth his family jewels are.” </p><p>Sunset clamped her thighs together, blushed, and coughed aloud. “<b>OH</b>! I understand now. Don’t worry, Rares; I’m not upset. He’s got a pretty big pair of stones. They’re practically impossible to miss out in the open. In case you were wondering, I had nothing to do with his… grooming habits. Heck, I’m not that into shaving my own crotch. Just enough to keep things tidy down there. I guess it makes them more fun to play with? <b>GAH</b>! Why am I even telling you this?!”</p><p>I tittered. “Because we’re such good friends~ As for Braeburn, he’s quite a bit hairier than Flash. And by that, I mean everywhere. It doesn’t bother me though. I find it adds to his rustic charm.”</p><p>Sunset shot me a ketchup smeared grin. “Is it true what they say about the Apple Family?”</p><p>“What exactly are you referring to, darling?” </p><p>Sunset nudged my arm and waggled her eyebrows. “That all the guys have monster schlongs. What? Don’t act so surprised, Rares. Practically every girl at Canterlot High fantasized about riding AJ’s brother bareback at some point. Myself included! For Celestia’s sake, he’s called Big Mac for a reason. Come to think of it, when I was visiting AJ back in Equestria, I never got the chance to take a peek at his undercarriage. Pretty sure his baby baton was sheathed anyway.” </p><p>Now, I was the one blushing. “I honestly don’t know! Braeburn’s never mentioned it.” </p><p>Sunset scoffed as she wiped her mouth with a napkin. “Of course, he wouldn’t. Braeburn’s too polite and modest. Plus, it’d be kinda awkward talking about your cousin’s dick with your GF.” </p><p>“It never ceases to amaze me how crass you can be, Sunset.” </p><p>My fiery-haired friend shrugged. “Well, tough shit. I’ve always been this way. I’m not some prim &amp; proper Manehattan socialite like you, Rares. I grew up in a Canterlot orphanage and learned about life the hard way. Had to get street smart, quick. Cut me a little slack.”</p><p>“I hadn’t intended to criticize you, darling. Merely making an observation. I love you just the way you are and I wouldn’t change a thing. Nor should you feel the need to in my presence.”</p><p>I yelped as Sunset practically leapt out of her seat and planted her amber derriere atop my lap, smothering me in a hug. She began to nuzzle my cheek with her own; a sign of affection amongst Equestrians as I had learned during my brief excursion there. I returned her embrace with equal affection, and placed a gentle kiss upon her forehead. Finally, after so many years apart, it felt like we were truly reconnecting as friends. She got up a little while later, her cheeks flushed and eyes filled with unshed tears. A single, wet sniff signaled her need for a tissue. </p><p>After blowing her nose into a soiled napkin, Sunset finally spoke, her voice thick with emotion. “Sorry about the waterworks. Equestrians are an emotional race and I’m not the type to hold back my feelings for the people I love. Thanks, Rares. I’m so glad to have you back in my life.”</p><p>I wasn’t on the verge of tears, but my chest was filled with warmth. “As am I, dear. How about we go join the others for a swim? I, for one, could use a refreshing dip right about now.” </p><p>We walked together, holding hands, towards the pool where Flash and Sweetie were playing with a beach ball. Noticing that his wife’s eyes were red and puffy, Flash put down the ball and looked at her with an expression full of concern. She waved it off, saying that we’d shared a personal moment together and that the tears were simply part of the process, and not indicative of any emotional distress. Thus mollified, he continued his game with Sweetie. As for Sunset and I, we stepped into the shallow end of the pool using the stairs. I shivered as the water enveloped my skin. It was far colder than I’d anticipated, but not unpleasant on such a warm day. </p><p>Sunset let go of my hand, and wadded over to her husband, who wrapped his arm around her waist. She cuddled up to him and they shared a kiss on the lips. What a lovely couple. Despite being from two separate worlds, it was as though they had always been meant for each other. A pang of loneliness gripped my heart, as I yearned for Braeburn’s warmth pressed up against me. My melancholy threatened to bring down the jovial mood of the current festivities, so I closed my eyes, took in a deep breath, and focused on the present. There was plenty of love to be had here. </p><p>Much to my surprise, Flash was the first one to speak up. “Hey there. It’s been a while, Rarity. Welcome back. Hope you enjoyed the food I made. Not the fanciest, but it works in a pinch.”</p><p>I waved my hand dismissively. “Perish the thought, darling. It was quite delicious.” </p><p>Sunset looked down at her feet for a moment before meeting my eyes. “Now that we’ve had a chance to fill our bellies, Flash and I wanted to discuss an important matter with you. It’s part of the reason why we invited the two of you out here in the first place. Please don’t get upset!” </p><p>I sighed and submerged myself deeper into the water, until it was up to my neck. “I’m not upset. In fact, I have a pretty good inkling as to what you’d like to discuss with me. Go on, dear.” </p><p>Flash cleared his throat. “We saw the pictures posted on the internet regarding the recent kidnapping in Manehattan. More specifically, the ones of a mysterious, masked vigilante who also happens to—ah—take the minimalist approach with her costume.”</p><p>“What Flash is trying to say,” Sunset continued, “is that we’re pretty sure it’s you, Rares.” </p><p>I let out a dry laugh. “It would appear that my identity is not as secret as I’d hoped.” </p><p>Sweetie interjected by wading over to me, placing her hand on my shoulder. “We all think what you did was totally awesome, sis! But you gotta remember: we know what your naked body looks like. It’s pretty obvious when you look at the pictures. That’s what they’re saying.” </p><p>“I thought that the mask, voice modification, and my fabulous sparkling skin would be an adequate enough disguise to throw most people off. Is that somehow not the case?” </p><p>Sunset nodded. “Normally, they would be. However, we’re biased in that regard, as we already know about your powers. It was just a simple matter of putting two and two together. That and you’ve got those nasty bruises all over your ribs. It’s a dead giveaway.” </p><p>“I see. Well then, I suppose I shan’t need to don latex body paint. Assuming, of course, that I ever intend to fight crime again. I’d much prefer to let that to the professionals.” </p><p>Sunset chuckled. “You probably shouldn’t do any nude modeling either. Just to be safe.”</p><p>“The Gala was a one-time event, dear. Besides, I was more covered up, in a manner of speaking, than when I rescued Sweetie &amp; Rara from the mercenaries. <b>IF</b>, and I stress if, someone was to make the connection that I was <i>Madam Adamantium</i>, then they’d have to have seen me unclothed during other circumstances. Even then, my skin wouldn’t have been sparkly.”</p><p>Flash rubbed his chin in thought. “I’d still lay low for a while, Rarity. With how social media is these days, you’re bound to attract more than a few obsessed fans. Whatever you decide to do from this point forward, Sunset and I wanted to let you know that you have our full support.” </p><p>Despite the emotional moment I’d shared with Sunset earlier, I began to tear up. Once they began, I could no longer keep my composure. “Thank you, everyone. It means so much to me to hear you say that. My life has become more and more complicated as of late and I’ve found myself in dire need of emotional support. I’ll try my best to make it up to all of you. I promise!”</p><p>We shared a group hug together, while I bawled like a baby. All the stress, anxiety, and pain seemed to have come rushing out of me all at once. I was a snotty, quivering mess, but my friends and family continued to embrace me regardless. The warmth of their skin pressed against my own, also helped to alleviate the loneliness I’d been feeling from Braeburn’s absence. It wasn’t quite the same as making passionate love to him, but a good substitute nonetheless. </p><p>I sniffed loudly. “Pardon me, everyone. I really must get a tissue. I shall return shortly.” </p><p>Once I’d gotten the opportunity to freshen up a bit in the bathroom, I came back to the pool and noticed that everyone had decided to bask in the sun instead of swimming. Sweetie was lying face down, fast asleep, and snoring quite loudly on one of the lawn chairs. Given her full belly and lack of sleep the night prior, I wasn’t surprised that she’d run out of energy to remain awake.</p><p>Flash busied himself with cleaning up the grill, while Sunset stood nearby, enjoying a chocolate-coated ice cream cone as she admired his backside. Ever the messy eater, a glob of vanilla ice cream landed on her breast, which Flash was more than happy to lick clean for his wife. The sound of Sunset’s giggles pervaded the air as his tongue tickled her perky pink nipple. </p><p>“Flash—wait—STOP—HAHAHA! You know I’m sensitive there!”  </p><p>I don’t believe they’d noticed my presence yet and since my sister was fast asleep, they promptly ignored her. Flash cupped his hands around Sunset’s buttocks and gave her cheeks a firm squeeze while peppering her neck with a flurry of kisses. She responded by slipping her hand in-between their waists and fondled the shaft of his penis until it slowly rose to attention. They were in their own little world, completely oblivious to everyone and everything around them. Before I knew it, they’d migrated over to a lawn chair, where Sunset was on her knees, busy performing fellatio on her husband. Quite enthusiastically, I might add. </p><p>Feeling more than a little awkward, I hesitated to interrupt them—erm—mid suck as it were. Flash leaned back in the chair and gripped the sides, moaning softly all the while. With a technique like that, I can’t imagine any man would be able to hold back for long. In a strained voice, Flash muttered his wife’s name, then grunted as he thrust his hips forward. Sunset swallowed every last drop of his seed. She even went so far as to lick his penis clean afterwards. </p><p>I approached them carefully, a deep blush coloring my cheeks. Can you honestly blame me? Their little display of marital love was arousing! When they finally noticed me, they looked like a couple of kids who’d gotten caught with their hands in the cookie jar. Flash crossed his legs in a vain attempt to conceal his erection, while Sunset wiped the remaining evidence from her lip. </p><p>“<b>HEY, RARITY</b>! We didn’t see you there. How long have you been back?” </p><p>I rolled my eyes. “Long enough to know exactly what you two have been up to out here. Flash, darling, you can uncross your legs now. I’ve already seen everything you have to offer and then some. Keeping them crossed like that can’t be comfortable. Relax.” </p><p>Blushing, Flash hesitantly complied with my request. His penis finally started to become flaccid again, resting sideways along his thigh. “No, it’s not. Sorry, Rarity. With my wife’s smoking hot bod, it’s hard for me to resist her charm when we’re spending time together in the nude.”</p><p>Sunset slowly raised her hand. “Me neither. I’m not sorry though. I love giving him head! Especially after he’s been sweating all day. It smells all musky and makes me super—” </p><p>I sighed and pinched the bridge of my nose. “That’s quite enough, darling. I get it.”</p><p>In an effort to dispel the awkward atmosphere between us, Sunset rushed over to the table and grabbed her phone, bare feet pattering against the concrete. She practically shoved the damned thing in my face, causing me to wince. When I took a peek, the screen displayed a picture of Rainbow Dash. “I know you’re still on the fence about this whole super heroine thing, but hear me out! RD’s a professional martial artist. Like, as in, wins championships for a living and trains people how to fight. If nothing else, she can help you defend yourself in a scrum.”  </p><p>I took note of her contact information, but bit my lip. “I don’t know, Sunset. In all honesty, training with a ruffian like her isn’t exactly on my list of priorities. There’s also the fact that I haven’t spoken to Rainbow Dash in years. She probably doesn’t even remember me.” </p><p>Sunset took hold of my hands, her expression pleading. “It’d make me feel a hell of a lot better knowing that you’re capable of defending yourself, with or without powers. I’m sure Coco, your sister, and Braeburn are of the same opinion. C’mon, Rarity! Just give it a try. Pleeeassse!” </p><p>“Hmm. I suppose it’s worth a try. Does Rainbow Dash know about all this?” </p><p>Sunset rubbed the back of her neck. “Nothing beyond what she already knew about you in high school. I highly doubt she’s followed any of your recent exploits at the Gala. But I did mention that you might be interested in visiting her dojo sometime. She’s cool with it; I promise!” </p><p>“Where is this dojo? Hypothetically speaking. I haven’t committed myself to a visit yet.” </p><p>Sunset seemed to have her heart set on me learning martial arts at Rainbow Dash’s dojo. A small part of me suspected that she’d been planning this meeting for a while. Or at the very least, since our sudden departure from Equestria. “Here’s the best part: RD recently opened a brand new one in downtown Manehattan! It’s only a couple of blocks away from your shop, Rares. A perfectly reasonable commute on foot any day of the week. What do you think?” </p><p>I broke out in a cold sweat as my stomach churned. Oh dear. She expected me to give her an immediate answer. “The best I can do is a phone call for the time being. No promises.” </p><p>Sunset let out something that sounded like a cross between a whinny and a girlish squeal. I’d never heard her do that before and it surprised me. I must admit, it was adorable. “You won’t regret going. Just think of it as bonding time with RD. And you can tone up while you’re at it.” </p><p>“Having a firmer butt and tummy would be nice. I imagine Braeburn might enjoy it too…” </p><p>Sunset punched my arm playfully and grinned. “That’s the spirit, Rares! Men love a little muscle tone on their ladies. Isn’t that right, dearest husband?” </p><p>She made a show of wiggling her shapely rump at Flash. He simply shrugged. “Sure do.” </p><p>Sunset proceeded to bend over at an angle that left nothing to the imagination, stuck her tongue out, and winked. “Don’t you worry, mister. You’ll get some of this soon enough.”</p><p>Flash cupped his scrotum and chuckled. “Might not be anything left in these guys for a while.” </p><p>“Alright! That’s enough flirting, you two. Or do I need to fetch the spray bottle?” </p><p>At that moment, Sweetie arose from her slumber and yawned. After stretching out for a bit, she padded over to where we were conversing and smacked her lips. “Why would you need a spray bottle? There aren’t any dogs around here. That reminds me. Gotta go pee. Be back in a jiff.” </p><p>While Sweetie went inside the house to take care of business, I started getting dressed. “Thank you both for hosting us this afternoon. We had a wonderful time. I wouldn’t want us to overstay our welcome and… interrupt your plans for the evening, as it were.”</p><p>Sunset wrapped me in another hug. “Later, Rares. Don’t be a stranger. Text me!” </p><hr/><p>The Cal Zone: Italian Restaurant &amp; Deli, Manehattan </p><p>Lorenzo entered the front door of his favorite eatery after a long day of work for the Magnolias. It was one of those ‘<i>hole in the wall</i>’ type places that didn’t look like much on the outside but served some of the best Italian food in the entire city. As he was a regular customer, the head chef/owner greeted him with a polite wave as he sat down in one of the booths. The owner’s daughter also happened to be one of the waitresses on duty that evening. </p><p>She was a young, raven-haired beauty with pale grey skin, and a trim figure to go with her modestly sized breasts. Estella was her name. Beyond having to wear formal attire for her job, she preferred to wear dark eyeshadow, purple lipstick, and various piercings all over her body. Despite her gothic appearance, she was friendly, if a bit succinct. That suited Lorenzo just fine. He wasn’t really in the mood to have a long, frivolous conversation with anyone. Even if it was with a cute girl like Estella. He didn’t even bother opening up the menu. The mobster knew exactly what he wanted: a chicken parmesan sub with a side of curly fries. It was the tastiest sandwich in the whole city. Estella sauntered over to Lorenzo’s table with notepad in hand and smiled.</p><p>“Well, if it isn’t Lenny. The usual today?” </p><p>Lorenzo nodded. “Yep. Oh, and could I get some tiramisu for dessert this time? Thanks.”</p><p>“Sure thing. It’ll be out in about twenty minutes. Enjoy a coffee on the house.” </p><p>While Estella brought out a mug and began to pour his beverage, Lorenzo leaned back in the seat and began to watch the television mounted on the wall. He yawned as it was just the daily weather report. He was about to browse the internet on his phone, when a special news bulletin flashed across the screen. He blinked twice, making sure that what he saw was real. </p><p><i>The mayor issued a statement today: warning the citizens of Manehattan not to take justice into their own hands like the so-called ‘Madam Adamantium’ did during a hostage situation. A vigilante of sorts, this pale-skinned primadonna wears nothing but a mask to conceal her identity. While some have condemned her as nothing more than an exhibitionist with an appetite for danger, others have praised her actions, saving the lives of Countess Coloratura and her young assistant whose name cannot be disclosed. Please report any sightings of this woman… </i></p><p>“Crazy huh,” Estella intoned, “takes guts to run around fighting mercs in your birthday suit.”</p><p>“Either that or she ain’t playin’ with a full deck o’ cards.” Lorenzo mused. </p><p>Estella chuckled. “Screw loose or not, she’s certainly got spunk. I happen to like the idea of a strong, female vigilante who isn’t afraid to let it all hang out and stick it to the man.” </p><p>“Odds are that sparkly bitch’ll end up gettin’ shot by the end o’ the month.”</p><p>Estella shrugged. “We’ll just have to wait and see.” </p><p>Lorenzo sipped his coffee and typed <i>Madam Adamantium</i> onto the web search. Unlike the news program, the internet version of her was uncensored. He had to admit that the woman was attractive, but something about her seemed familiar. As he stared at her sparkling skin, one peculiar night in particular came to mind. Lorenzo nearly spit out his coffee. It had to be the same crazy naked bitch who’d saved Joe from certain death. There was no mistaking a svelte body like hers. Lorenzo dialed a number he seldom used. The Godfather would need to know. </p><p>“What do you want, Lorenzo? I’m a very busy man.” Vincenzo Magnolia replied in a smooth, baritone voice with a slight Italian accent. </p><p>“Papa Vin, please forgive the disturbance. I’ve got somethin’ ya need ta see.” </p><p>After receiving a photo of the nude vigilante, Papa Vin became annoyed. “Is this your idea of a joke?! I don’t care what sort of pornography you enjoy looking at in your spare time, but this isn’t the least bit amusing. Explain yourself or I shall send someone to break your legs.” </p><p>“Remember the woman I told ya about? Ya know, the one who saved Joe. That’s her!” </p><p>Papa Vin hummed in thought. “Are you certain?”</p><p>“Positive, boss. I’d never forget a body like hers. Since she was—um—naked and all. Heh.” </p><p>“Naturally. Tell me, Lorenzo. What threat does she pose to our organization?” Papa Vin asked. </p><p>“I’m not sure. What I do know is that she ain’t normal. And I don’t mean on account of her runnin’ around the streets of Manehattan without a stitch of clothing on. Her skin’s—like—impervious ta bullets n’ knives. Maybe she’s… an alien or something like that.” </p><p>“Very interesting indeed,” Papa Vin concurred, “this matter requires further investigation. You have done well informing me of this new development. Enjoy your chicken parmesan sub.” </p><p>Lorenzo swallowed a lump that had formed in his throat. “Anytime, Papa Vin.”</p>
