		<h1>My Ignominious Introduction to MMA</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 17</b></p><p>Rarity’s Jewelry Shop, Manehattan</p><p>The utter chaos that had plagued our lives over the course of the past few days had finally begun to settle down for us. Sweetie went back to working at Rara’s recording studio, and was doing well by all accounts. As for me, I threw myself into my craft, creating commissions for several clients and a few generic pieces for immediate sale out on the shop floor. I’d put in long hours, and shed far more sweat than a proper lady should but I found the work to be immensely gratifying. However, I must admit that it was an effective method of taking my mind off of the whole “<i>superheroine</i>” situation. I still had yet to call Rainbow Dash and arrange our sparring session. Sunset assured me there was no rush… but guilt is a very powerful motivator. </p><p>A quick glance at my phone told me that it was already a quarter past two in the afternoon. Since it was Friday and I’d made sufficient profit for the week, I decided that closing the shop a tad early wasn’t going to do any harm. I put away all of my tools, turned off the smelter, and willed my body to return to its natural state. That’s non-sparkly, if you’re keeping track. Technically, I could craft jewelry with just raw material, magic, and brainpower, but I found doing things the old-fashioned way helped fuel my creative mojo. There was something to be said about the tactile sensation of a hammer and tongs in one’s grasp, shaping the metal into a work of art. </p><p>That being said, whatever I did consumed energy and magic. It was not an effortless process, as I’d come to learn. Metalsmithing was a marvelous way to keep in shape, I must profess. Even so, I still ate a healthy diet, and would occasionally do some yoga here and there when time allowed. After wiping my face with a rag, I ran upstairs to the sales floor and changed the open sign to closed. When I opened the door to my office, I realized that I’d neglected to put any clothes on. </p><p>The air-conditioned environment felt amazing against my bare skin, but I scolded myself for making such a blunder. It was fortunate that my shop had fully enclosed display windows. Otherwise, I might have given everyone on the street a peep show. Not to mention clients. After letting out a frustrated sigh, I gazed upon my body in the mirror. My hair was matted down with sweat and I was covered, head to toe, in grey soot. I gave my armpit an experimental sniff and recoiled at the pungent aroma. Above all else, freshening up was to be my top priority.  </p><p>What wonders a twenty-minute shower can do for a woman! After toweling myself dry, I threw on a pair of loose-fitting, light purple gym shorts and a matching tank top. I wasn’t a big fan of socks, but if I was going to be wearing sneakers anyway, it would help prevent painful chafing and blisters. With those all tied up, I did the same with my hair, using a scrunchie to keep everything tidy. There you have it! One sporty Rarity, ready for whatever the day throws at her.  </p><p>Like Sunset had said, Rainbow Dash’s dojo was only a few blocks away from my shop. Ergo, I was more than happy to get some additional exercise by walking there. However, I would need to call her first. The last thing I wanted to do was show up at her dojo unannounced. With a quick tap of my finger, I dialed Rainbow’s video icon on my phone and waited for her to answer. Much to my surprise, her answer was almost immediate. I cleared my throat before speaking. </p><p>“Good afternoon, darling. I trust you’re doing well.” </p><p>“Sup, Rares?” Rainbow asked nonchalantly while examining her fingers.  </p><p>“First things first, did Sunset fill you in on all the details? I’d rather not—”</p><p>Rainbow chuckled. “Sure did. Don’t worry; we’ll take things slow. I know you’re a newbie.” </p><p>“Yes… well, that being said: would you mind if we conducted our first session this afternoon?” </p><p>“I dunno,” Rainbow mused while tapping her chin, “I’ll have to check my <b>SUPER</b> packed schedule. Seeing as how I’m kind of a big deal on the MMA scene. Let’s see here… I think I could squeeze you in today. How long will it take you to get here?”</p><p>I let out a quiet sigh of relief. “Not terribly. My shop is only a few blocks away.” </p><p>Rainbow grinned. “Cool. I’m just fucking with ya, Rares. Today’s been pretty slow.” </p><p>“Oh. Alright then. I shall see you in approximately twenty minutes. Ta-ta, dear.” </p><p>Rainbow made a point to show me a table full of food. “I’ve got snacks n’ shit, if you want. Just make sure you eat after the session. Trust me; you <b>DO NOT</b> want to fight on a full stomach.” </p><p>“I wasn’t planning to. But thank you for the offer, regardless.” </p><p>Rainbow sniffed. “Don’t mention it. Later, Rares.” </p><p>The façade of the dojo appeared as though it had come straight out of a kung-fu movie made several decades ago. Which, given Rainbow Dash’s personal taste in cinema, I would say was entirely unsurprising. Even so, I restrained myself from making any harsh judgements. This was her livelihood, after all. She could build however she wished. With a polite smile, I approached the receptionist, who was wearing a rather risqué silk Chinese dress (<i>the slit practically went the whole way up to her hips</i>) and informed her that I had an appointment with Rainbow Dash. </p><p>She bowed and offered to guide me to one of the training rooms. I followed along and marveled at the décor. Surprisingly enough, it was very tasteful and traditional. Rainbow Dash wasn’t entirely gauche when it came to interior design, it would seem. Sure enough, the woman herself was standing in the center of the room, wearing tight black spats and a sports bra. She was barefoot, save for some cloth wraps and her tomboyish haircut was much shorter than it had been in high school. I assume because of the dangers posed from opponents being able to grab onto it. </p><p>Did I mention that her attire left little to the imagination? It accentuated Rainbow’s lithe, athletic frame quite nicely. Firm muscle along her thighs, arms, back, and stomach attested to the many hours she’d put in honing her body for competitions. She’d never had a very large bust to begin with, and even now there was only the slightest hint of mounds hidden beneath her sports bra. Feeling wholly inadequate in the presence of a professional MMA fighter, I smiled awkwardly and waved. After taking a few big gulps from her water bottle, Rainbow stuck out her hand.</p><p>“Welcome to my dojo!”</p><p>I shook it, and winced at how strong her grip was. “Hello, dear. It’s nice to see you again.” </p><p>“Likewise, Rares. How long’s it been? Like—uh—a couple of years at least, since we last saw each other in person. By the way! I saw your jewelry exhibition thing on the internet. I thought it was totally awesome! Takes some serious <i>cajones </i>to walk around in nothing but a layer of paint.”</p><p>I tittered, motioning towards my waist. “As you’ll recall, I don’t have any <i>cajones</i>~”  </p><p>Rainbow laughed aloud at my terrible joke. Perhaps, a bit harder than was appropriate. “Seriously, though. You look even more amazing than you did back in high school. I can see that you’ve already got a little muscle tone going on. Do you work out?” </p><p>“Thank you, Rainbow. As a matter of fact, I do work out on occasion.” </p><p>Rainbow cracked her knuckles. “Good, ‘cause I expect you to be able to keep up the pace with me during our sparring session. I know what you’re thinking: ‘<i>Dashie’s gonna kick my ass</i>’. Well, I’m here to tell ya that won’t happen. We’ll take things slow at first, ok?” </p><p>I watched as the receptionist left the room, closing the door behind her. “I’ve been meaning to ask, darling: why in the world do you force your staff to wear such risqué outfits? Her dress would be more suitable for a cosplay café than a professional dojo. Have you no standards?” </p><p>Rainbow actually blushed. “I didn’t force Xian Li to wear that dress! She suggested it herself during one of our monthly meetings. You know, to bring in more customers. It’s the whole sex appeal bit. Otherwise, most people think MMA fighters are all butch and scary. C’mon, Rares! She rocks that look and you know it. Especially with those long legs and tight butt. Hehe~”</p><p>I rolled my eyes. “You’re still a raging horndog. I see that hasn’t changed…” </p><p>Cheeks still rosy, Rainbow Dash coughed. “Whatever. Let’s get down to brass tacks.”</p><p>“Fine by me. Before we begin in earnest, how much did Sunset tell you about my situation?” </p><p>Rainbow shuffled closer to me and wrapped her arm around my shoulder. Then, in a conspiratorial whisper, she gave her reply. “Your secret’s safe with me, Rares. Filly Scout’s honor. For the record, I dig the whole ‘<i>taking on the bad guys bare-assed naked</i>’ routine. Besides the mask, of course. Any self-respecting superheroine has to keep her identity hidden.  Combined with magic powers that makes you a nine point five on the badass scale at least!”</p><p>I groaned. “Just marvelous! Sunset assured me that she was going to be discreet about my heroic escapades. Am I going to have to worry about you accidentally revealing my identity?” </p><p>Rainbow Dash waved her hands. “No way! I’m not an idiot, Rares. I know how to keep my lips shut when the occasion calls for it. I’m sorry it’s just—EEEEEEEEE—I get to train with an actual superheroine! This is <b>SO AWESOME</b>!!! Heh. Sorry. Like I said, lips are sealed tight.”</p><p>“This isn’t a comic book, Rainbow Dash! Our lives could be put at risk if the wrong people are made aware of my supernatural abilities. That’s the whole reason why I wanted to train with you. I need a way to defend myself should magic fail me somehow. Luck, more than skill, was on my side when I saved Rara and Sweetie. Please take our sparring session seriously!” </p><p>Rainbow shot me a guilty look, and rubbed her arm. “My bad, Rares. Guess I got caught up in all the excitement and forgot to take all of those factors into account. Just so you know: I’ve never used my geode powers in a fight. That would be totally unfair to my opponents. What kind of MMA champion would I be if I cheated, right? Ok. I’m super serious now. Promise.” </p><p>I placed my hand on her back. “Rainbow, I never doubted your sincerity. I just—it’s a heavy responsibility having so much power. Part of me wishes that I’d never found that blasted opal, but there’s no point in dwelling on what could have been. All I can do is put my best foot forward and try to prepare for the worst-case scenario. Now, what should we do first?” </p><p>Without saying a word, Rainbow shimmied out of her spats and bra, tossed them aside, then began to do some warmup exercises. Completely taken aback, I stared at her naked body for a moment (<i>the rainbow-colored tuft of hair covering her loins was unexpected</i>), trying to understand why she’d do such a thing. She only paused when I didn’t join her in stretching out. Had it not been obvious enough before, there wasn’t a trace of fat to be found anywhere. Her demure breasts hardly moved at all when she placed her hands on her hips and scowled at me. </p><p>“Work with me, Rares. I’m trying to make this as comfortable for you as possible.” </p><p>I blushed. “My apologies, I wasn’t aware that our training sessions were clothing optional.” </p><p>Rainbow rolled her neck from side to side. “S’not like a sports bra and spats cover much up anyway. Besides, you’re gonna be fighting naked. You might as well train that way too. That said, I do have a couple rules: no powers, no cheap groin shots, and no hair pulling. Got it?” </p><p>I carefully removed my tank top and shorts, then folded them into a neat pile by my sneakers. A shiver of anticipation raced down my spine as I looked around the dojo and took in a deep breath. I scrunched my toes against the mat. “A stupid question from an amateur, if I may?” </p><p>“Stupidest question is the one left unasked. Shoot.” Rainbow replied. </p><p>“Aren’t we going to use any protective equipment? Like boxing gloves and whatnot?” </p><p>Rainbow shook her head. “Nothing except for mouth guards. You’re welcome to wrap your hands and feet too, if you want. We have to make this as realistic as possible.”</p><p>I frowned. “I’m going to have a lot of bruises by the end of today, aren’t I?” </p><p>Rainbow placed her hands on my shoulders. “I know you can take it.”</p><p>After letting out a shuddering sigh, I splayed my legs and took on a fighting stance. “Very well, darling. Just… promise me that you’ll try to hold back on the strength of your punches. I don’t want to go home looking as though I’ve been mugged. Sweetie has enough to worry about, I—”</p><p>“Relax, Rares. I know what I’m doing. I wouldn’t have my own fucking dojo otherwise.” </p><p>Somehow, her brash confidence did nothing to bolster my own. My stomach felt like it was going to leap out of my throat. “Perhaps, I should ask Sunset if she knows any healing spells…”</p><p>“For Pete’s sake! Unclench your butthole for sec, would ya? I’m not just gonna start slugging away. We need to work on your form first, then comes the actual punching and kicking.” </p><p>My cheeks flushed beet red as I huffed, puffed, and stomped my feet against the mat. It was all rather childish, I admit. “How am I supposed to know that? I’m not a professional fighter!”</p><p>Rainbow Dash laughed at my expense. “But you sure are easy on the eyes. Especially when you get mad. It’s super cute. That counts for something in my book. What? Don’t act so surprised, Rares. I’ve had a crush on you since high school. Granted, not a serious enough one to act on because you’re obviously not into dating other chicks. Neither was AJ. What a shame…” </p><p>Mortified and thoroughly uncomfortable at the idea of Rainbow ogling my body, I nearly walked out of the dojo in a sputtering rage. Instead, like a true lady, I steeled my resolve. “Please don’t make this any more difficult than it needs to be. The last thing I need is for you to get handsy.” </p><p>“Look, I’m trying to be honest here. I think you’re hot, but I also respect you as a friend. There’s no way I would <b>EVER</b> act like an asshole and take advantage of the fact that we’re both naked. Isn’t that what friendship is all about? Trust n’ shit. I’m not sorry for what I said. It’s the truth!” </p><p>I relaxed somewhat and unclenched my fists. “Are there any other revelations you’d like to share before we begin? I’d like to get some actual training done today, if it’s not too much trouble.” </p><p>“Nah. We’re good. First thing you need to do is find your center of balance. That’s it, spread those legs far apart. Under different circumstances, I would—”</p><p>I scowled at her. “Would it kill you to focus on the task at hand?”  </p><p>“Right. Sorry! Focusing on the training, not flirting. Like I was saying, you need to have a strong center of balance, not only for setting up strikes but to keep you on your feet. Otherwise, you’ll get knocked flat on your ass and make yourself vulnerable to attack.”</p><p>Rainbow placed her hands on my hips to help demonstrate the proper fighting posture. She showed me how to punch using my core muscles in short, powerful strikes, instead of the comically overdrawn punches I’d seen demonstrated in movies and cartoons. Rainbow also stressed that where you hit your opponent was of vital importance. I made an earnest effort to copy her techniques, but I still felt like a fish awkwardly floundering on the shore. </p><p>The MMA fighter grinned. “See? You’re getting the hang of it!” </p><p>“Do you really think so?”</p><p>Rainbow retrieved a towel and wiped her face. “You’re already in decent shape, Rares. Endurance is half the battle. But—uh—you should probably try to condition more if you want to improve muscle strength. Nothing major. Ya know, like some weight lifting or push ups.” </p><p>I took a much-needed swig of water. “I suppose I could incorporate them into my regimen.” </p><p>Rainbow balanced on one foot and performed a series of impressive kicks with the other. Unhindered by clothing, one could see every muscle working in concert. There was a certain grace to her technique but not in terms of how one might consider traditional feminine beauty. Her chiseled physique was a testament to the spirit of determination, strength, and athleticism. </p><p>“Normally, doing something like that would be tough. But since I’ve built up core strength, not only is balancing easier, but I can project more power into my kicks. Don’t worry; we won’t be practicing techniques like that for a while. You’d end up straining some muscles. S’not fun.”</p><p>I nodded in agreement. “I noticed that my powers draw energy while active. If I overexert myself, there are terrible consequences. Not only that, but they only offer so much protection.” </p><p>“Twi tried to explain the science behind it to me one time. Real egghead stuff, despite being—uh—magic. But I know what you mean. Same thing happens to me if I go overboard with my super speed. I get exhausted and then motion sickness hits me like a dump truck. Like, puking buckets all night long. The geode must act like a magical dampener for my body.” </p><p>I shuddered. “Oh, dear. That sounds dreadful!”</p><p>Rainbow plopped down on the mat and sat with her knees bent, feet splayed apart. “I’m not a teenager anymore, so I tend to use my powers more sparingly nowadays. Prefer to rely on my own strength instead of magic. Makes me feel a greater sense of accomplishment, ya know?” </p><p>I remained standing, as I didn’t want my sweaty bum sticking to the mat. Besides, I wasn’t sure how sanitary it was either. Best not to take any chances. “I try to do the same with my jewelry, but I must admit, the additional abilities I’ve gained make crafting so much easier.”</p><p>Rainbow shrugged. “Eh. To each their own. Why don’t we call it a day and hit the showers? Today’s session was meant to be an introduction, and I think we covered the basics pretty well.”</p><p>“Are you sure? I don’t feel as though I’ve progressed much at all…” </p><p>Rainbow sprang to her feet, padded over to me, and gave my bottom a playful swat as she walked by. I couldn’t help but let out a surprised yelp in response. “Learning how to fight takes time, practice, and patience. Trust me; you’re doing ok for a beginner. Let’s cleanup for now.” </p><p>While rubbing my slightly red derriere (<i>it stung more than I cared to admit</i>), I followed Rainbow towards the shower room with a bundle of clothing tucked in the crook of my arm. I was expecting them to be rather utilitarian but the décor reminded me of the facilities in Neighpon, with painted panels along the walls. A wide variety of shampoos, soaps, and miscellaneous toiletries were available to choose from. I made my selections and picked an open stall, where Rainbow joined me shortly thereafter. We didn’t bathe together underneath the same faucet, but there was no privacy to be had as nothing separated the individual shower stalls. </p><p>“Hey, Rares. If you ever need a sidekick to help fight the bad guys, I’m here.” </p><p>Bath pouf in hand, I paused before lathering my stomach. “I suppose you would be the most qualified to fight in such a situation. All I can say is: we’ll see. I’m not comfortable involving my friends and family with the whole ‘<i>vigilante</i>’ business. As I’ve told Sweetie many times before, I’d prefer to remain a humble jewelry smith and leave crime fighting to the professionals.” </p><p>“Super-heroing doesn’t have to be a full-time job. Just do it when the occasion calls.” </p><p>I allowed the hot water to wash away all the soap suds coating my skin. “When exactly would that be, Rainbow? I can’t very well go dashing out the door every time a cat gets stuck in a tree or someone’s purse gets snatched. The logistics are simply mind boggling!” </p><p>“I dunno. All I’m saying is that if you have the ability to save people, you should!” </p><p>I sighed. “The same could be said of everyone’s geode powers. Yet, we’ve all lived relatively normal lives since graduating high school. I don’t need to add any more drama in mine.” </p><p>Rainbow placed her hands on her hips. “If that was the case, you wouldn’t have bothered visiting my dojo today. Think about all those corrupt, incompetent cops out there. Do you really believe that the people of Manehattan will get any help from those losers? Of course, not! They need <b>YOU</b>. I’ll be there to back you up when the shit hits the fan. In ten seconds flat! All I’m asking is for you to consider taking up the mantle of <i>Madam Adamantium</i>.” </p><p>I turned off the faucet and retrieved a towel from the rack, drying my hair while I considered her proposal. “I promise that I’ll give what you said some serious thought. However, I don’t want you to foist delusions of grandeur upon me, like I’m some sort of holy savior of Manehattan. The best I can offer is to keep my eyes and ears open. Then act accordingly. Does that seem fair?”</p><p>Rainbow gave my arm a playful punch and grinned ear to ear. “Awesome! I knew you had it in you, Rares. You won’t regret this! Can I come up with my own cool sidekick name? Oh, and one other thing, do I have to run around bare-assed naked? I’d rather not, if that’s ok with you.”  </p><p>I heaved a heavy sigh while toweling off my lower extremities. “One step at a time, darling. For now, let us get dressed and retire to the snack bar. I’m feeling rather peckish at the moment.” </p><hr/><p>At Rainbow’s insistence, I consumed a berry-flavored sports drink. She claimed that it would do me a world of good to replenish the electrolytes I’d lost through sweat. It wasn’t as bad tasting as the usual brands I’d had the unfortunate displeasure of drinking, but I still wouldn’t go out of my way to purchase it regularly. Besides, it was apparently Rainbow’s own brand of sports drink that she’d spent years trying to perfect. I politely accepted and ate a banana, along with a cup of vanilla yogurt as a snack to sate my appetite until dinner. Once that was all done, we agreed to meet again for more sparring sessions, and she gave me a few tips for my exercise regimen. </p><p>While I was walking back to the shop, I received a text from Sweetie. Not unusual, at first glance, but the subject matter certainly was. In an effort to bond with her employee, Coloratura invited Sweetie over for dinner and a show, later on in the evening (<i>Manehattan was famous for musical theater productions</i>). There’s no way my little sister would pass up on an opportunity like that. From what I understood, Coco would be joining them. Ergo, it seemed that I would be alone in the apartment with only Extravagance to keep my company for the remainder of the day.</p><p>Given how utterly exhausted I felt from an entire day of metalworking and martial arts combined, I was in no mood to cook my own meal for dinner. In the back of my mind, I considered what my takeout/delivery options were while I ascended the elevator to my apartment. The first thing I did after opening the door was to undo the scrunchie and let my hair down. I then took off my shoes and placed them neatly by the doorway for future use. </p><p>I paused for a moment. Something was amiss. Hackles raised, I looked over at the couch again and had to blink a few times to confirm what I had witnessed. There, laying on his back with one leg propped up at an angle, was Braeburn. Not only that but he’d brought along a lovely little box of chocolate truffles and a bouquet of roses. Did I happen to mention that he wore nothing but a smile to greet me with? Overjoyed at his presence, I scrambled to take off the rest of my clothing, tossing them aside into a messy pile on the floor. I proceeded to pounce on him. </p><p>He tried to say hello, but I wouldn’t let him. At least, not yet. We had some catching up to do with our lips. I took hold of his cheeks and kissed him hungrily and passionately. Not the kind where one wrestles tongues, but where both parties struggle to catch their breath respectively. Oh, how wonderful it was to breathe in his scent, to feel the heat of his bare skin pressed against my own. I embraced him with all of my might, placing my head against his hairy chest; our naked bodies soon became a multicolored tangle of limbs. </p><p>He began to run his fingers through my hair. I let out a contented sigh. “How’s mah favorite gal doin’ this fine afternoon?” </p><p>“Much better now that you’re here again, my love. How I have missed you!” </p><p>Braeburn chuckled while I kissed his chest. “Been feelin’ a might lonely mahself. I’m afraid there’s still work ta be done with the harvest, but Ah can stay with ya fer a little while.” </p><p>I peered over the edge of the couch and spotted the goodies he’d gotten me. “You didn’t have to buy me anything, darling. Your presence alone is enough.”</p><p>“S’alright. Ah wanted ta spoil ya. Figured keepin’ mah clothes on was pointless too…” </p><p>Not wasting any time, I slid my hand in-between his legs and found my target. His penis was still flaccid but I intended to change that in a matter of moments. “Agreed. They only get in the way.”</p><p>Before long, Braeburn became rock hard within my grasp. I was just about to start pumping his shaft with my fingers, when he stopped me. Dumbfounded, I was at a loss for words. Before I had a chance to form any kind of coherent response, he picked me up princess style and carried me towards the bedroom. Like a true gentleman, he placed me atop the bed carefully and smiled. </p><p>“Spread apart yer legs a bit, darlin’. It’ll make what Ah do next a helluva lot easier.” </p><p>I did as he suggested, albeit with a modicum of hesitation. Part of me wanted to a thoughtful lover and satisfy his needs, but the growing heat building within my loins begged to be sated. Much to my own embarrassment, and Braeburn’s amusement, when he used his fingers to spread my lips, the salmon-pink folds contained within were slick with arousal. I blushed furiously, but that did not stop him from diving right in for a taste. While his tongue swirled around inside me, I let out an involuntary and quite audible mewl of pleasure, gripping the bed sheets as I did so. </p><p>I don’t know where he found the endurance to keep licking me at such a vigorous pace without making his tongue cramp up, but I certainly wasn’t complaining. By this point, I felt an intense orgasm beginning to build deep within my belly and if that weren’t enough, he teased my nubbin between his thumb and finger, applying just enough pressure to elicit mind-numbing jolts of pleasure down my spine. Then it happened. I let go of my inhibitions and rode the orgasm. My back arched upward and my toes curled as I moaned aloud and coated Braeburn’s face with cum. </p><p>While I laid back on the pillow, panting, he crawled on top of me and we kissed. I could taste myself on his lips, but it made little difference. The afterglow felt amazing. “Hope yer not tuckered out yet. We haven’t even made it ta the main event. Lemme know when yer ready.” </p><p>In-between breaths, I managed to utter, “I want to pleasure you too. Please, let me—”</p><p>He teased my nipple with the tip of his finger, causing me to squirm. “Eenope. None o’ that. Makes me happy when Ah git ta see ya feel good, Rares. Take a second ta catch yer breath.” </p><p>When enough time had passed to regain some of my composure, I simply nodded to Braeburn to signal that I was ready for the next portion of our love-making session. My legs were already splayed far apart, so it was not difficult for Braeburn to scooch forward and line up his waist with the lower half of my own. I spotted his manhood in all its erect glory, pointed upward and ready to penetrate my glistening folds. The anticipation was palpable. Already sensitive from my previous orgasm, I gasped when he rubbed the bulbous tip of his head along my lips. I knew it was to ensure proper lubrication before we joined as one, but I still fidgeted with impatience. </p><p>I don’t believe Braeburn had meant to enter me so abruptly, but that’s how it happened. A strained mewl escaped my lips at the sensation of being filled so completely. I’d forgotten just how thick his member was… not that I was complaining, mind you. I shifted my position a little to get more comfortable and he began thrusting in earnest. It started out gentle and slow, then gradually built up as we found a tempo that suited our carnal needs. I wrapped my legs around his waist and my arms around his shoulders, as the sound of flesh meeting flesh pervaded the air. </p><p>“Rarity… Ah,” Braeburn whispered in a strained voice, “Ah don’t think I’ll last much longer.” </p><p>I tightened my embrace around him. In more ways than one. Voice husky, I responded, “It’s ok, my love. Cum whenever you’d like. I’m prepared to milk every last drop out of you, if I must.”</p><p>That was all the more motivation he needed. After a few deep, powerful thrusts, Braeburn clenched his butt cheeks together and cried out my name as his seed filled me to the brim. He did so in several spurts. Each one just as hot and thick as the last. That said, when Braeburn finally rolled onto his back and laid beside me, we’d made a considerable mess of the bedsheets. Despite our disheveled state, I nestled into the crook of his arm while he rubbed my back. </p><p>“Thank you, darling. I quite enjoyed your surprise gift.” </p><p>“I’d say the pleasure was all mine but that ain’t exactly true.” Braeburn joked. </p><p>“Indeed. As much as I’d love going another round, I’m utterly exhausted. It’s been a long day.” </p><p>Braeburn yawned. “I’m in the same boat. Spent most o’ the day haulin’ whiskey barrels.” </p><p>“Yet, you still found the energy to satisfy me~” I teased while playing with his chest hair. </p><p>“Man’s gotta be able ta do that much fer the woman he loves.” </p><p>Overcome with emotion, I began to tear up while I kissed his cheek. “I only wish there was more I could do for you, darling. With all the drama going on in my life recently, it feels as though you are the only thing that has remained constant. Have I somehow neglected our relationship?” </p><p>“Hey, now. Don’t talk like that, sweet pea. You’ve got a lot on yer plate.”</p><p>I rubbed my foot along his ankle affectionately. “I’ve been meaning to have a serious conversation with you regarding my new abilities and how they’ll affect our lives.”</p><p>“I’m game, so long as we can git cleaned up n’ grab a bite ta eat.” </p><p>I giggle-snorted. “Goodness, me! I’d nearly forgotten about dinner in all the excitement. Would you believe me if I told you that this was the third time I’ve had to bathe today? Next thing you know, I’ll have to start calling myself Pruneity. I’ll draw the bath if you order the food, dear.” </p><p>Reluctantly, we broke our embrace and got out of bed. While I lumbered (<i>I was a bit sore; the good kind of sore</i>) towards the bathroom, Braeburn went out to the kitchen in order to retrieve his phone. He poked his head in the doorway to ask me what kind of food I wanted. Shrugging, I suggested Chinese, as it was cheap, tasty, and most importantly, the shop around the corner offered free delivery within a certain radius. To make things easier, we ordered a large Mu-Shu chicken platter, along with a side of pork fried rice. I didn’t normally feed Extravagance such rich human food, but he’d been well-behaved and let us have our privacy in the bedroom. </p><p>The bulldog nuzzled my ankle with his moist snout, vying for attention while I knelt beside the edge of the tub. I picked him up by the waist and cradled him in my arms like one would do with a child. Ever the ham for attention, he let out a satisfied whuff when I rubbed his tummy and praised him for being such a good boy this evening. </p><p>Braeburn entered the room at that precise moment, and offered the spoiled canine additional affection by way of head scratches. I placed Extravagance directly into the tub once it was full of hot water, as sharing a bubble bath with him was a time-honored tradition in my household. Braeburn didn’t seem too bothered by an additional bathing companion, as Winona would often do the same at Sweet Apple Acres.  </p><p>Leaning back while I shampooed my hair a third time, Braeburn began to scrub his arms. “Ah saw the video of ya savin’ Sweetie n’ Rara from those mercs. Is that what ya wanted ta talk about?” </p><p>“After giving it a lot of thought, I’ve come to the conclusion that I might be able to help the people of Manehattan with my abilities. By no means am I going to do so on a permanent basis; that's the police force’s job. I’m talking about unusual circumstances, when immediate assistance might not be available. I realize it shall be dangerous but I’d be remiss if I didn’t.” </p><p>Braeburn placed his hand on my shoulder as a show of reassurance. “Figured you’d say somethin’ like that. If it’s any consolation, Ah support whatever decision ya make, Rarity.”</p><p>“Even if it means that our lives may be put in jeopardy?” </p><p>Braeburn nodded. “Reckon it’s the risk ya take, datin’ a gal with magic powers. Ta be perfectly honest, Ah think ya bein’ a superheroine is downright sexy. Even better on account o’ the fact that ya don’t need a costume while yer fightin’ crime. Except fer that mask, o’ course.” </p><p>I blushed while rinsing my hair. “I hadn’t intended to become the subject matter of everyone’s lurid comic book fantasies. But there’s no putting that genie back into the bottle, as it were.”</p><p>“Take it as a compliment, Rarity. Ya look great. Always have, in mah opinion.” </p><p>I put on the best sultry smile I could come up with and traced my foot along Braeburn’s inner thigh, stopping just short of teasing the lower hanging bits of his manhood. His expression was priceless. I proceeded to flutter my eyelashes. “Flattery will get you <i>everywhere</i>, darling~” </p><p>“Careful there. Yer bound ta git me excited again. Heh.” </p><p>I laughed. “Hmm. I’ll just have to take care of it, won’t I?” </p><p>Our silly little bout of flirting was rudely interrupted by the sound of my doorbell ringing. Without a second thought, I hopped out of the tub, dried off just enough so that I wouldn’t trail puddles of water all over the apartment, and opened the door. A bored-looking delivery man from <i>Kung-Kapow City, </i>stood in the hallway and raised his brow when he saw me. I chuckled awkwardly, realizing that once again, I had forgotten to cover up. Such was the plight of a life-long nudist living in Manehattan. His surprise quickly turned into irritation. </p><p>“You gonna pay me for the food, lady?” </p><p>“Oh—erm—yes, one moment please. I have to fetch my purse.” </p><p>Once I gave him the appropriate amount of cash (<i>plus a generous tip</i>), he appeared to be satisfied. “I apologize for the lack of attire. I just got out of the bath and forgot to put on a robe.” </p><p>The delivery man shrugged. “Third person this week who show up naked at door. Happens all the time in this profession. Say, do I know you, lady? You seem familiar. Like I see you before from somewhere. Can’t remember where though.&quot; </p><p>Absolute dread washed over me while I stood in the doorway. Was the mask not enough to conceal my identity? Or was this a simple case of the man recognizing me from the pictures taken at the Gala?  </p><p>Scratching his grizzled cheek, the man smirked. &quot;Hey, you kind of remind me of that crazy, sparkly naked woman who fight thugs in warehouses. Posted all over internet! Anyway, enjoy the food. Bye now!”</p><p>“Ah, yes… I’m certain I will. Thanks again for stopping by!” </p><p>Still nude, Braeburn joined me at the table while I unpacked the pork fried rice and put some in a bowl for Extravagance. He embraced me from behind and kissed my neck. “Looks tasty.” </p><p>“Indeed, it is. I’ve ordered from <i>Kung-Kapow City</i> on many occasions.” </p><p>Braeburn sat down and made a Mu-Shu wrap for himself. “Ah thought Sweetie was supposed ta be stayin’ with ya fer her internship. Before ya ask, since she’s seen me nekkid before, Ah figured it wouldn’t be a big deal if Ah took mah clothes off while waitin’ fer ya ta come home.” </p><p>I waved my hand. “She’s going to be out late, I imagine. If you’re worried about sleeping arrangements, don’t be. I have a guest room set up for her. Sweetie is also old enough to respect our privacy. What happened back at <i>Cala Concha</i> was merely an unfortunate accident.” </p><p>“So, if we wanted ta make love tomorrow mornin’…”</p><p>I leaned over, nibbled on his ear, and fondled his penis just enough to get my point across. It amused me to see how wide his eyes became afterwards. “I would most certainly be amenable to such an arrangement. If Sweetie doesn’t like it, then she’ll just have to sleep out on the couch.”</p><p>We enjoyed a peaceful, quiet dinner together while gazing out at the Manehattan skyline. A part of me wished that our lives could be like this all the time, but knew that it never would be. Instead of dwelling on such melancholy thoughts, I chose to live in the moment, and treasure the time I had with my paramour. After dinner, we snuggled on the couch and watched some TV until we felt sleepy enough to go to bed. Thankfully, I had plenty of clean sheets to replace the ones we’d soiled before. By the time I began to close my eyes, all the stress and worry faded away, replaced by the warmth of Braeburn’s embrace as he pulled me closer to his chest.</p>
