		<h1>Once Upon A Time In Manehatten</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 1 </b></p><p>Rarity’s Apartment, Manehatten </p><p>There was something to be said about taking a bubble bath after a long day. A luxury some may not have been able to afford, in terms of time or expense, but one that I indulged in quite regularly. If not for the sake of getting squeaky clean, but also to relax the muscles and unwind. To cleanse one’s mind of unpleasant thoughts as well. With a contented sigh, I reached over and brought my favorite wine goblet to my lips. </p><p>It was such a gaudy thing. A gift bought for me at some Renaissance Faire that Twilight had attended with a few of her other friends a while ago. Despite this, I cherished the goblet as if it were made of actual gold instead of gold-plated. After all, it did an excellent job keeping my wine cool. And more importantly, from spilling all over the place. Upon taking a few generous swigs (<i>by that I mean half the glass</i>), I placed it on the plastic bath tray I had sitting by the tub and sunk deeper into the water. </p><p>Yes, I know what you’re thinking. What’s a sophisticated lady such as myself doing with a tacky, plastic tray? For one, hardly anyone ever sees the blasted thing and it’s practical for eating and drinking off of when one is inclined to do so whilst bathing. Simple as that. In any case, it was an investment well spent on my part. Upon lifting my foot out of the water, the distinct pitter-patter of little claws clicking along the tiled floor pervaded the air. Just as I suspected, my loyal companion has arrived to join me for bath time. </p><p>Extravagance, or “<i>Trav</i>” as I like to call him, is an English Bulldog. I bought him as a puppy about two years ago and I absolutely love him to bits. His coat is nearly all white save for a large brown spot on his right eye. Since the bathtub is a bit too high for him to climb into on his own, he let out a soft “<i>whuf</i>” and looked up at me with his pudgy little face. Bizarre as it may seem, he actually loves taking baths with me. Far be it for me to dissuade a canine with proper hygiene habits. </p><p>“Be patient, darling. I’ll get you in here with me in just a moment. I promise.” </p><p>I had to lift myself out of the tub a bit, but the effort was well worth it to see his jowls turn upward into a happy smile. After Trav got comfortable, he let out another whuf and nuzzled his snout against my leg. In turn, I proceeded to lather up his fur with conditioner. While I was washing him, my mind began to imagine new jewelry designs. </p><p>That’s my profession, you see. I studied at Canterlot’s most prestigious academy for gemology and general metallurgy a few years back. Upon graduation, I decided to say goodbye to Ponyville and move to Manehatten, so that I could open up my own shop. It had always been a life-long dream of mine, ever since I was a little girl. You know, outfitting people with beautiful jewelry to enhance the natural beauty already present. But I digress. </p><p>Once I finished washing Extravagance and lounged in the tub for a little while longer, I decided that it was time to get out. I didn’t want my skin to get all pruney. A quick toweling off later, I stood in front of the mirror and observed my reflection. I considered myself fortunate for having good genes and a splendid figure. My breasts have never been terribly large; they are quite firm actually. But with enough jiggle to be appealing to those who would admire them. My areole, on the other hand, are noticeably large. Come to think of it, my mother’s areole are as well. I imagine it must be a hereditary trait amongst the female members of my family. </p><p>With wide hips, a toned waist, pale complexion, and what my friends deemed as a “<i>Desirable Posterior</i>”, I suppose I was what many would consider an attractive woman in her early twenties. Although, I think it had more to do with the fact that I ate healthy and took very good care of my body through a regular exercise routine. Such as yoga, pilates, jogging, you get the idea. It didn’t hurt that I felt extremely comfortable in my own skin. People tend to pick up on that sort of thing while I’m in public, even if I happen to be wearing clothes. Suffice to say: I am quite confident about the way I look and I’m not afraid to let people know it! </p><p>As for personal hygiene, I prefer to keep as clean shaven as possible. Wax and various micro-dermal treatments do wonders for keeping those irritating little red bumps from appearing. There is one place, however, that I prefer to keep my hair intact—erm aside from my head, that is. Between my legs lies a neatly trimmed triangle of royal purple pubic hair. </p><p>I’d tried waxing all of it off once, at the behest of my friend, Rainbow Dash. Being an athlete, she seemed to prefer being as close to hairless as possible. Something about fitting in spats and being more aerodynamic? I honestly don’t know. Whatever the case, I couldn’t help but feel childish at the time when I looked down at my bare womanhood. I’m not certain if this is the case with most women, but I rather like having some semblance of hair covering me. It makes me feel—how shall I say—more mature. As sure a sign as any that I am a grown woman. </p><p>After brushing my teeth, I searched the cupboard for a dental bone to give to Trav. Given how much he licks me and is in my general vicinity, I’d rather not have to smell dog breath all of the time. With a few noisy crunches, he finished his treat and we headed out into the living room. I immediately made myself comfortable on the couch, waited for Trav to sit in-between my legs, and turned on the tv. Nothing beats watching a crime drama after a hot bath! </p><p>Just as I was starting to get into the program, I heard the doorbell chime. I glanced over at the clock and cursed. Who the hell would want to visit my apartment at nine forty-three at night?! Honestly! Thinking fast, I grabbed the silk robe hanging near my door (<i>specifically for greeting unannounced guests</i>) and wrapped it around my body as best I could. I’d rather not bother with the damned thing, but society demands that I preserve my modesty at times. </p><p>My annoyance at having to clothe myself evaporated in an instant when I saw who it was. The teal-haired woman standing in the doorway was none other than my esteemed colleague and good friend, Coco Pommel. We exchanged a quick hug and then I welcomed her inside. Once I’d gotten her a mug full of hot chamomile tea, I took off my robe once more and sat next to her on the couch. She seemed rather stressed out: dark circles underneath the eyes, clammy skin, a slight flush to her complexion. All the usual signs of an unhappy, anxiety-laden Coco Pommel. Like any good friend would do, I wrapped my arm around her and began to rub Coco's back. Trav, in turn, took the opportunity to sit atop her lap. </p><p>“Whatever is the matter, dear? You seem… stressed out. Is there something I can do?” </p><p>Coco sighed. “I’m sorry for barging in on your evening time, Rarity. It’s just that I’m really anxious about the new dress order I got today. The client is well-known and very influential amongst the wealthy circles here in Manehatten. What if I mess it up?!” </p><p>“Why don’t you take a moment to calm down, then we can talk about it.”</p><p>I suppose you’re all wondering why Coco didn’t have an adverse reaction to my nudity. Well, there’s a perfectly reasonable answer to that question. Albeit, a long, and complicated one. We must start at the beginning. During my childhood, more specifically. You see, my parents have been devout naturists their entire lives. They raised both me and my sister in a clothes-free household. Most people would find this sort of lifestyle strange, but it was quite normal for the both of us. </p><p>Therein lies my general dislike of anything involving textiles. Intimates or otherwise. If I had a motto it would go as follows: “<i>Nude when possible, clothed when practical</i>”. There are plenty of advantages to be had when one decides to embrace naturism. For starters, there is little laundry that needs to be done. It is far more comfortable doing anything in just your bare skin and it promotes a positive attitude regarding one’s personal image.  </p><p>My sister and I were quite fortunate in that regard. We never had to struggle with the awkwardness of puberty’s effects on our bodies, since it was plain to see every day. It gave us the opportunity to deal with it directly instead of hiding from it. That and our parents were very straightforward when it came to answering any questions regarding sex and intimacy. I thank my lucky stars every day for it too. I have no doubt that it has made me into a well-adjusted adult. </p><p>Even though I’m comfortable being a naturist, it was never an aspect of my life that I advertised to others. Mostly out of fear that they would misunderstand and label me a pervert or a loose woman. On numerous occasions during high school, I would make up excuses just to avoid having a sleepover at my house, knowing full-well that my family would’ve been uncomfortable being forced to wear clothing in front of my friends for the sake of propriety. I’m not sure if the girls ever picked up on my reluctance, but they never called me out on it either. </p><p>To date, the only people I’ve ever told the truth to are Coco and Applejack. Being a former unicorn, I suppose Sunset would understand but she and I aren’t exactly what I would call close friends. The topic was simply never broached between us. In any case, now that I’m older, I shall make it a point to be more forthright with the rest of my friends should the opportunity present itself. </p><p>Coco took a sip of her tea. “It’s the Oranges, Rarity. They’re hosting this year’s charity gala and they picked <b>ME, </b>of all people,<b> </b>to design all of their outfits. I-I’m not nearly as famous as some of the other fashion moguls like Sassy Saddles or Hoity Toity. Oh goodness! I’m never going to sleep tonight. This is terrible! What should I—”</p><p>I held Coco closer to me while simultaneously stroking her hair. “Listen to me, Coco. I know for a fact that you’re an excellent designer of the highest caliber. If there’s anyone in Manehatten who deserves to have her talent recognized, it’s you.”</p><p>“That’s easy for you to say! How can someone who hates wearing clothes as much as you do possibly be an expert on what’s fashionable in today’s market?” </p><p>I chuckled. “Guilty as charged, I suppose…” </p><p>“I’m so sorry, Rarity. I didn’t mean to insult you or your lifestyle. I know you have an eye for aesthetics, otherwise your jewelry wouldn’t be so beautiful. I’m just so… frazzled right now.”</p><p>I leaned over and kissed Coco’s forehead. “It’s quite alright, darling. I completely understand. There have been days where I’ve wanted to do nothing more than rip my hair out and scream at the top of my lungs like some crazed lunatic. Is the tea helping at all?” </p><p>“A little. Would you mind if I… stayed here for a little while? I’m afraid that if I went back to my apartment right now, alone with my thoughts, I’d have a panic attack. Again, I’m REALLY sorry for imposing on you all of the sudden. If there’s anything I can do to make it up to you…” </p><p>I got up and poured myself a glass of water. “Nonsense, darling. The friendship we share isn’t about keeping score. It’s about trust and being there for each other when we need it most. I’m certain you’d do the same for me, were I in your situation. Now, what would you like to do?” </p><p>Coco blushed. “Well, if it’s not too much trouble, could I lay my head down on your lap?” </p><p>In a way, it was very humbling to know that Coco trusted me so much. She was usually such a skittish girl, to the point of being an anxiety-ridden mess whenever physical contact was concerned. It was a wonder in and of itself how she managed to cope with Manehatten’s crowds on a daily basis. Nonetheless, I patted my lap and she laid her head down without a shred of hesitation. As I brushed her hair with my fingers, she finally began to relax. </p><p>“Mmm. You smell really good, Rarity. What kind of soap did you use?” </p><p>“The usual,” I replied, “plumeria with just a hint of lavender.”</p><p>“That’s nice. Skin’s soft too. S’like I’m laying a big marshmallow.” </p><p>I smiled. “A proper lady must always take good care of her body, you know.” </p><p>It wasn’t long before I heard Coco’s soft snores. Ever so carefully, I lifted her head off of my lap and placed down a pillow for her to use. Ever the gentledog, Trav fetched a spare blanket and made sure that Coco was comfortable before he headed over to my room. I quickly followed suit after letting out a protracted yawn. It was only a little after ten-fifteen but I didn’t see any sense in staying up later if I was tired. Once I crawled into bed, put on my sleep mask, and pulled the covers over myself, I drifted off to sleep. Hopefully, Coco would feel better in the morning. </p><hr/><p>I awoke the next morning feeling refreshed. After going through a few stretches to limber up, I padded over to the window and peered outside. My apartment was situated on the ninth floor, so I got quite the stunning view of Greenway Park every day. Not to mention, I was close enough to it that I often took the opportunity to go for a walk, weather permitting. </p><p>Even though it was already late spring, the weather had not become unbearably hot yet. As was my custom, I always slept in the nude but I knew that I’d done my fair share of sweating during the night. With that in mind, I took a quick shower and brushed my hair just enough to make it look presentable. I could tell that Extravagance was up as well, for I felt him give my ankle an affectionate lick as I applied a light coating of make-up to my face and some lip gloss.  </p><p>I glanced towards the couch while I made my way into the kitchen to make some breakfast. Coco was still fast asleep, of course. Not entirely surprising given that she needed the rest. I made sure to be as quiet as possible so as not to wake her prematurely. Hmm. What to make was the question. I was no slouch when it came to cooking, but sometimes one just wishes to do away with the effort and prepare something simple. I figured that French Toast fit the bill perfectly. </p><p>Once I got the coffee brewing, the smell of it managed to rouse Coco from her slumber. I had to stifle a giggle when she shuffled into the kitchen. Her normally pristine bob-cut was an absolute mess, strands askew everywhere, and her clothing was severely wrinkled. Not at all surprising, given that she’d slept in them. I was still in the process of preparing the French Toast, but I did turn around and greet her with a smile. </p><p>“Good morning, Coco. Did you sleep well?”</p><p>“Mhmm. Morning.”</p><p>I gestured the spatula towards the coffee pot. “I believe the coffee is nearly finished brewing. Feel free to pour yourself a mug and have a seat at the table. Breakfast should be ready soon.” </p><p>Coco didn’t say much after that. I all heard was the occasional sound of her sipping, but otherwise we didn’t converse with one another for quite some time. When the French Toast was finally done cooking, I slid a piece onto her plate as well as my own and took a seat across from her. After a few dainty bites, Coco’s cheeks flushed red and she let out a frustrated sigh. </p><p>“What’s the matter, darling?” </p><p>Coco shuffled her feet underneath the table. “I’m a mess. I want to take a shower and freshen up but…”</p><p>“You don’t have any spare clothing. I understand. Well, why don’t you go hop in the shower and I’ll launder them for you.”</p><p>“What’ll I wear in the meantime? Our sizes aren’t even remotely close.”</p><p>I grinned. “I think the answer should be obvious: nothing all, darling.” </p><p>Coco blushed even harder. “I don’t know if that’s—”</p><p>“Appropriate? Pardon my frankness, but who the hell cares? It’s just you, me, and Extravagance. What exactly do you have to lose, Coco? Your dignity? Pshh! We’ve seen each other naked plenty of times before during our trips to the spa. Seriously, it’s not a big deal.”  </p><p>“Umm… I suppose so. I’ll take you up on your offer then.”</p><p>With a nod, I finished up my slice of French Toast and watched her head towards the bathroom. While I waited for her to finish freshening up, I picked up Trav and sat him on my lap. Since it was my day off, I decided to indulge in reading the newspaper for a bit. Sure enough, the headline talked all about the Charity Gala and how the Oranges were hosting it at their estate across town. A sudden knot formed in my stomach. Had I dismissed Coco’s concerns too blithely? </p><p>My thoughts were interrupted when Coco finally emerged from the bathroom and padded over to the table once more. Her steps were shaky and hesitant; it was clear to me that she wasn’t entirely comfortable with walking around in the nude so casually. Unfortunately, she’d always been very self-conscious about her body. Seeing her tense expression saddened me somewhat.  </p><p>In my honest opinion, I didn’t think she had anything to be ashamed of. She had a petite figure, long, slender legs, and a crème-colored complexion very similar to my own. Her breasts were on the smaller side, but beautifully shaped, akin to tear-drops. The pièce de résistance was, of course, the fuzzy little patch of teal-striped hair nestled between her legs. She was the epitome of adorable, no, I would even go so far as to say that she was stunning. </p><p>I put down my paper and flashed her an encouraging smile. “See? Doesn’t that feel a whole lot better than wearing a bunch of wrinkly, sweaty clothes? Go ahead and take a seat. I’ll fetch another cup of coffee for you.”</p><p>Once Coco had a chance to acclimate being nude, she visibly relaxed. I imagine that Trav was a big help as well, considering that he made a point to sit next to her and give Coco a few affectionate licks. After she was about halfway through her mug, Coco began tapping her fingers against the table. Whether it was the caffeine, nerves, or a combination thereof, I couldn’t say.  </p><p>“You understand why this commission is such a big deal to me, right? The who’s who of fashion will all be there. Not to mention a pretty big gathering of celebrities. If I mess this up, my name will go down in history as the girl who ruined the Charity Gala.”</p><p>I reached over and rubbed her thigh. “I understand perfectly, dear. This is, dare I say, a once in a lifetime opportunity for you to make your brand shine. But I know you can do it! I’ve caught up with all of my orders for the week, so if you need someone to support you through this, all you need do is ask. I shall be at your shop in two shakes of a lamb’s tail!” </p><p>“Umm… about that. I may have mentioned your name to the Oranges.” </p><p>I raised my brow. “Oh? Why is that?”</p><p>Coco bit her lip. “Well, they asked me if I knew any good jewelers. Because they were looking to commission a centerpiece for the auction as well. I hope you’re not angry…” </p><p>“Heavens no, darling. I’m glad that you did. Crafting a centerpiece for one of the most famous events in the city shall no doubt get me more customers! It’s practically the best advertisement a girl could ever hope for! Did they happen to mention when I would be contacted?” </p><p>Coco blushed furiously. “Not exactly. Ah—that is to say… I told them that you would be accompanying me to the luncheon to discuss details.” </p><p>“Coco, darling. I get the distinct feeling that you aren’t being forthright with me.” </p><p>“Sorry! The luncheon is later today! Since you had the day off, I-I figured it would work out.”</p><p>I let out a deep sigh and rubbed my temples. “I suppose it’s fortunate that I’m laundering your clothing then. Not to worry dear, I’m a woman of my word. I promised that I would help you in your hour of need and I shall. Just… try to give me more of an advanced warning next time, ok? I don’t enjoy being put on the spot. Especially when it concerns potential clients.” </p><p>Coco practically jumped out of her chair and hugged me. “Thank you, Rarity! You’re a lifesaver! I don’t what I ever did to deserve such a wonderful friend.”</p><p>“You’re quite welcome, dear. Now, back to the matter at hand. Is this luncheon a formal event or will casual attire be acceptable? I’d rather not have to wear anything fancier than is strictly necessary. I’m sure you understand…” </p><p>Coco coughed and composed herself. “Oh no, they insisted that it was supposed to be casual. I wouldn’t be going in just a skirt and blouse otherwise.”</p><p>“Excellent! I have just the outfit in mind.”</p><hr/><p>Coco and I remained nude for the rest of our time together before the important meeting with the Oranges. It surprised me that she hadn’t immediately rushed to the dryer to retrieve her garments when the buzzer rang. Perhaps this was a sign that she was finally starting to get more comfortable in her own skin. That was my hope, anyway. As for me, I chose something simple to wear: a long, flowing summer dress that reached just below my knees. It was butter-yellow and contained a repeating pattern of daisies. </p><p>It was a gift from Sweetie Belle on my birthday last year. Needless to say, I wore absolutely nothing underneath the dress. I only ever clad myself in underthings when the situation truly necessitated it, like if I was wearing a mini-skirt or something. A pair of stylish sandals completed the outfit. Coco seemed to think I looked cute. That was enough for me.  </p><p>After a few last-minute touch ups, we took a taxi to the other side of town where Orange Manor resided. It was a splendid palace of old-world grandeur and money. Something that would not have looked out of place in the middle of Prance during its heyday. Upon notifying the security guard, we were escorted to the main room where two members of the esteemed family met us: Mosely &amp; his wife, Dalia Orange. </p><p>The patriarch of the Orange clan was a man in his mid-forties. Tall, clean-shaven, and impeccably combed forest green hair. He was dressed in a tan suit with a light purple tie that accentuated his bronze complexion. Dalia was around the same age, clad in a fashionable, maroon pant-suit. Her honey-hued hair was styled in a tasteful bun. She had much lighter skin than her husband and I could see clear evidence of freckles, despite how little she showed. </p><p>Both of them greeted us warmly and with a firm handshake. As we walked to the dining area, I took a moment to admire the paintings hung along the walls. While I hardly considered myself an expert on such matters, a few of them appeared to be classics from the bygone eras of yore. All of them must have been expensive. Before long, we arrived at the table to be seated. </p><p>Much to my surprise, there were a few other guests seated across from us. And two very familiar ones at that! Applejack and her cousin Braeburn had decided to join in on the festivities as well. This, of course, made perfect sense as they were family to the Oranges and most likely involved in the preparations. Food and beverages, I would imagine. </p><p>After a great, big bear-hug, Applejack grinned. “Howdy, Rares! Didn’t think I’d ever find ya at my uncle’s manor. What’re ya doin’ here?” </p><p>“Coco invited me, as a matter of fact. We have some business to discuss with your aunt and uncle in regards to the Gala. I do hope I’m not imposing.”</p><p>Applejack waved her hand. “O’ course ya ain’t! Go on and git situated, we’ll serve ya up some grub. Ah reckon my aunt n’ uncle ordered some o’ that famous Manehatten pizza they’re always ravin’ about. Speak o’ the devil, here it comes now!”</p><p>Sure enough, an impeccably dressed waiter brought several boxes of hot pizza to the table. Coco looked as though she was about to have a panic attack over the lack of decorum, and everyone else simply dug in. It was rather… anti-climatic to be honest. Being famished myself, I opened up a box and chose a few choice slices of mushroom and prosciutto. The taste was heavenly!</p><p>Dalia wiped her mouth with a napkin and turned her attention towards me. “I do hope the pizza is to your liking, Ms. Belle.”</p><p>“Certainly, Mrs. Orange. It’s quite delicious, thank you.” </p><p>“That’s good to hear. I believe you’re already well-acquainted with my niece and nephew, so I’ll skip the introductions and get straight to business, if you don’t mind.”</p><p>I clapped my hands together. “Ah! Straight to the point. A woman after my own heart.”</p><p>“Here’s how we’ve set everything up so far: Applejack will be in charge of the deserts, while Braeburn will be providing the refreshments for all of the guests. Fine spirits and whatnot. Ms. Pommel will be making a matching set of outfits for my family, as tradition dictates.” </p><p>“Naturally.”</p><p>Dalia took a big swig of her iced tea and continued. “As for you, Ms. Belle, I have something special in mind. I’d like you to create a one-of-a-kind necklace to serve as the centerpiece for the auction. Budget is of no consequence, since the proceeds will all be going to charity anyway. Coco told me that you are quite the skilled jewelry smith. Is this true?” </p><p>“I don’t like to brag about my work, but I do consider myself a skilled craftswoman.”</p><p>Dalia reached into her pocket, held up one of my black pearl earrings, and admired it. “My dear, this is far beyond what I would call mere ‘<i>competence</i>’. It’s exquisite! I’m convinced now more than ever that you are the right woman for the job. That is, if you’d be willing to work for me.” </p><p>I blushed at the praise. “Thank you, ma’am. I’m honored to hear such a compliment.”</p><p>“Well deserved, I assure you. What say you, Ms. Belle? Will you accept my commission?”</p><p>“It would be my pleasure to craft whatever you’d like, Mrs. Orange.” </p><p>“Excellent. I’ll email you all of the details later. For now, let us enjoy ourselves!” </p><p>The rest of the luncheon went by as well as could be expected. I chatted a bit with Applejack and Coco seemed to calm down after her third slice of pepperoni. You know, for such a petite girl, my fashion-conscious friend packed quite an appetite. I couldn’t help but giggle at the impressed whistle Applejack directed at her while Coco was busy wiping her sauce covered lips. Seeing Coco blush like that was both precious and adorable at the same time. </p><p>Applejack nudged my arm. “Man, Rares. Look at ‘er go! That gal-pal o’ yers could put Big Mac ta shame with them choppers. And Ah thought Ah was a hearty eater!” </p><p>“Indeed. Coco is quite an interesting character, once you get to know her.” </p><p>AJ adjusted her Stetson and looked over at Coco. “Is that so? Reckon Ah might need to go introduce mahself and get to know ‘er a bit better. She’s the one designing the outfits, right? Sorry, Ah just sort of assumed that. Uh—given the posh look she’s got goin’ on.” </p><p>“No need to apologize, dear. She’d take that as a compliment.”</p><p>“Good. Ah didn’t want ta make ‘er feel awkward or whatever. See ya around, Rares.” </p><p>While Coco and Applejack got better acquainted with each other, I took the opportunity to finish my sparkling water and glance over at Braeburn. It had been a long time since I’d last seen him. We’d last conversed at an Apple Family reunion in Ponyville about three years ago. Right when I had begun attending college to perfect my craft and learn more about jewelry making. </p><p>From what I remember, he still looked just as handsome as he had before, perhaps even more so with age. Back then, I wasn’t terribly interested in getting involved with anyone because I was too busy focusing on my studies. But now that things had finally begun to settle down for me, I found myself intrigued by the idea of a relationship. In any case, my romantic life had been neglected long enough. It was time for a change. Fortune favors the bold, Rarity!  </p><p>After a quick napkin wipe, I dusted off the crumbs from my lap, and approached Applejack’s cousin. “Hello, Braeburn. It has been far too long since we last met! How are you doing?”  </p><p>Ever the gentleman, Braeburn tipped his Stetson. “Afternoon, Rarity. I’m about as well as Ah could be, given the circumstances.”</p><p>“Pardon my curiosity, but what do you mean by that?” </p><p>Braeburn rubbed his neck. “Aw, it ain’t nothin’ a gal like you should be worryin’ about.”</p><p>“No, please do go on. I don’t mind listening.” </p><p>Braeburn sighed. “Well, alright. As ya might well imagine, mah Auntie put me in charge o’ the refreshments. Since there’s gonna be quite a few folks at the Gala, I’ve had to make sure that there’s enough ta go ‘round for everybody. Involves a bit of heavy liftin’. Casks and whatnot.” </p><p>“I see. So, I take it that your muscles are sore?”</p><p>Braeburn frowned. “Yeah. They’re all pretty worn out. Normally, I wouldn’t be too bothered by it, but… Ah got this nasty crick in mah back for some reason. It’s buggin’ the hell outta me.” </p><p>“Aww, you poor thing. Do you think a massage might do you some good?” </p><p>Braeburn shrugged. “Ah dunno. It might. Regular aspirin doesn’t seem ta help much.” </p><p>“You’re in luck! I happen to know a wonderful spa downtown. If you’re interested, I could take you with me as my plus two. And afterwards, we could grab a bite to eat. What do you say?”</p><p>Braeburn shifted in his seat. “Uhh… ya mean like a date?”  </p><p>“Mhmm. What? Is that a problem, Braeburn? If you’ve already got plans, I can—”</p><p>Braeburn waved his hands. “<b>NO</b>! Ah mean—hold yer horses for a second, Rarity! I’m definitely interested. Just let me know when ya wanna go out, so I can plan accordingly.”</p><p>I couldn’t help but grin like a Cheshire cat. “Perfect! It’s a date then.” </p><p>Before he could even formulate a response, I whipped out my phone and sent him my number via infrared. The astonished look on his face and the slight redness that colored his cheeks told me all I needed to know regarding his <i>personal interest</i> in me. As I walked away, it took everything I had to maintain my composure when I met up with Coco again after the luncheon concluded. How long had it been since I openly flirted with a handsome man like that? Far too long, I say! </p><p>Once we were in the taxi, I let out a breath that I hadn’t known I was holding. “<b>SWEET MERCIFUL HEAVENS</b>! I can’t believe I just asked Braeburn out on a date!” </p><p>Coco nearly jumped out of her skin when she heard me shout. “Am I missing something?” </p><p>“Sorry, darling. My excitement got the better of me. To make a long story short, I just asked one of the Apple Family’s most eligible bachelors out on a spa date~ Isn’t that marvelous?”</p><p>“Umm—I don’t mean to sound judgmental, Rarity but aren’t you jumping the gun a bit? You only just met him and at a business meeting, no less. He might think you’re a floosy.” </p><p>I snorted with laughter. “I assure you he won’t. Braeburn and I have known each other for quite some time, darling. I was always attracted to him but I never found the right time to ask if he was ever interested in me as well. Now, I have my answer! Ooooh! This is going to be so much fun!” </p><p>Coco smiled and took hold of my hand. “I’m happy for you, Rarity.”</p><p>“I appreciate it, dear. By the way, how was your chat with Applejack?” </p><p>Coco leaned back in the seat and closed her eyes. “We’ve got a lot of different interests, but I feel like we got along really well despite all that. I think we’ll be really good friends.” </p><p>“Indeed. You couldn’t ask for a more honest and dependable friend than her.”</p><p>The rest of the ride, we shared a comfortable silence, knowing that we had plenty of things to look forward to in the coming days. I kissed Coco on the cheek as she exited the taxi, and waved one final goodbye to her as she ascended the stairs to her own apartment. When I finally got home, I stripped out of my dress and got comfortable on the couch. With Extravagance snuggled up against my side, we binge-watched a crime drama series and ate a Chinese take-out dinner together until I decided it was time for bed. Starting tomorrow, my life was about to get a whole lot more interesting.</p>
