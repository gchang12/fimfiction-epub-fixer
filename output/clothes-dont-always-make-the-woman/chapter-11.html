		<h1>I&#039;m A Little Horse, How About You? (I)</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 11</b></p><p>Sunset &amp; Flash’s House, Canterlot</p><p>I wound up accepting Sunset’s offer of staying the night. It at least gave me the opportunity to communicate with all of the concerned parties that I was going to be away for some time. For the sake of simplicity, I told everyone that I had to take care of a family issue. Generally speaking, most people would believe my explanation without a second thought. In particular, I felt terrible for Coco, as I had essentially pawned off Extravagance’s care in her capable hands. She didn’t seem to mind, but nonetheless, I felt as though I was taking advantage of her. Since she was one of my closest friends, I’d told her about my powers and what the situation was. She took it about as well as I could have hoped but there were many questions that I had to answer afterwards.  </p><p>I lounged around the house in nothing but a t-shirt and a pair of gym shorts. No bra or panties. Well, I should clarify that none of Sunset’s undergarments would have fit me anyway. We had completely different body shapes and bust sizes. Sunset was… decidedly more curvaceous than I. Don’t get me wrong; she was in excellent shape! It’s just that her proportions were noticeably more filled out than my own. Flash was indeed lucky to have captured the eye of such a beauty. </p><p>Speaking of, Flash Sentry himself appeared a few hours after I’d arrived. Much to my surprise, he was dressed in a rather dapper navy-blue suit and looked happy but tired at the same time. I gushed with joy when I saw the two of them kiss. It was so adorable~ After taking off his suit coat and tie, he poured himself a glass of whiskey, sat down on the couch, and sighed. When I finally managed to gather enough courage, I sat down next to him and placed my hand on his shoulder. You see, it had been quite some time since I last spoke with him. </p><p>“Good evening, Flash. How are you faring in life?”</p><p>Flash blinked several times; I assume he was trying to figure out if I was real. “Hey, Rarity. I—uh—didn’t expect to see you here. Is there something going on that I should know about?”</p><p>I couldn’t help but chuckle. “You always were a clever one. Very well then. I shan’t beat around the bush. Recently, I happened to acquire some rather potent magical abilities. Abilities that, shall we say, are beyond human comprehension. To that end, I’ve asked Sunset to accompany me to Equestria, so that I might find an expert to help me control my powers.” </p><p>Flash took another swig of whiskey. “It’s always magical shenanigans with you girls. No matter how much time passes, I can’t ever seem to get away from them. Eh. Whatever. I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Any idea how long you two are going to be away ‘<i>on vacation</i>’ for?”</p><p>Sunset took a seat next to him and rested her head against his chest. “The jury’s still out on that, hun. I’ll leave my journal here just so we can communicate with each other, but this might take a while. Based on what Rarity’s told me so far, I suspect we might need Twilight’s help.” </p><p>“Why not just call her then? I know she’s busy with hadron collider experiments but—”</p><p>Sunset laughed and booped his nose. “Not that Twilight. I’m talking about the Princess.” </p><p>Flash blushed. “Oh yeah. Sorry, I still get them confused sometimes. The booze probably isn’t helping either. In any case, I guess you guys don’t really have much of a choice, do you?” </p><p>I shook my head. “I’m afraid not, darling. Believe me, I wish there was another way. But humanity isn’t in a position right now to help me with any issues regarding magic. If I revealed my powers to the public, I would be treated like a scientific specimen for the rest of my life.”</p><p>“Alright. Just be careful.”</p><p>The three of us didn’t say too much after that. I mean, what else could be said? After making a simple dinner of spaghetti and meatballs, Sunset kicked off her fuzzy slippers and stripped out of her robe. I shot her a questioning look and she merely shrugged her shoulders at me. Flash didn’t seem to be phased by her nudity in the least, so I padded over to the sink to pour myself another glass full of water. After I finished, Sunset stood before me and tapped her foot on the tile floor. </p><p>“You might as well take your clothes off now, Rarity.” </p><p>“I’m sorry?”</p><p>Sunset let out an exasperated sigh. “I keep forgetting that you’ve never gone through the mirror portal before. Here’s the deal: whenever a being goes through to either side, their bodies change shape drastically and instantaneously. So, whatever you’re wearing will just end up getting ruined on the trip. Traveling completely nude is our best option. That applies to jewelry as well, I should add. Trust me; it sucks having piercings suddenly shifted to the wrong spot.” </p><p>I winced. “Oh. Yes, I suppose that makes sense.”</p><p>With some degree of hesitance, I looked over at Sunset to make sure if it was ok to take off my clothing. Not that I was ashamed to do so, but rather… I wasn’t entirely certain about how Flash might react. I don’t believe there was ever an occasion where he’d seen me nude before. With an encouraging nod, I proceeded to strip and fold the garments in a neat little pile atop the table. </p><p>Sunset padded over to Flash and kissed his cheek. “We’re ready to go, hun.” </p><p>As expected, when Flash looked over at me there was a moment of awkward silence between us. I tried to remain calm and casual about the whole thing, but I could easily tell that he was distracted by my naked body. With a loud cough, he blushed furiously and tried to focus his attention on Sunset instead. My fiery-haired friend responded by standing in front of her beau, and pressing her ample bosom against his chest. This seemed to have the desired effect. </p><p>“Sorry. I-I didn’t mean to… stare at her.” Flash mumbled. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, hun. Rarity’s an exceptionally beautiful woman. It’s hard not to appreciate all of the hard work she’s put into maintaining her physique. Especially, when it’s on full-display. Just remember that you’ve got an equally beautiful, equally naked, girlfriend right here in front of you~”  </p><p>Flash kissed her on the lips. “Thanks for being so understanding, Sunset. Sometimes, I wonder how I got so lucky having such a wonderful woman like you in my life.”</p><p>Sunset blushed and played with a strand of her hair. “Yeah. Well, the feeling’s mutual. Alright! Enough of the rom-com theatrics. We’ve got a mission. Let’s get to it!” </p><p>Without preamble, we walked out to the car. Sunset and I sat in the backseat together while Flash took the driver’s seat. Given that we were right in the middle of a suburban neighborhood, it was bizarre to be riding inside of a car whilst completely nude. I highly doubt any of their neighbors would report us for indecent exposure, since it was quite dark outside. Even so, I felt incredibly anxious and hoped that my sweaty bottom wouldn’t leave a wet spot on the upholstery. Embarrassing for a woman to admit, I know, but it was an involuntary reaction on my part. </p><p>I must’ve looked the part because Sunset reached over and began stroking my thigh. “Just take a deep breath and try to relax, Rarity. We’ll be at CHS before you know it.” </p><p>“That’s not what I’m concerned about, darling. I just—never mind, you’ll think I’m being silly.” </p><p>“No, I won’t. Promise. Tell me what’s on your mind.” Sunset whispered encouragingly. </p><p>I let out a shuddering sigh. “The very thought of traversing across dimensions terrifies me to no end! From a logical perspective, I know that it’s a relatively safe process, considering that both you and Princess Twilight have done so on several occasions. But… I can’t help thinking of all the things that could go wrong. What if my magic interferes with the transfer? I don’t want to wind up losing my limbs or come out on the other side as some disfigured monstrosity!” </p><p>Sunset bit her lip. “Damn. That’s… actually a good point.”</p><p>“Hold on a second,” I shrieked, “You don’t actually know if it’s safe for me to cross?!!” </p><p>Sunset chuckled and looked down at her feet. “Uh… that is to say, Twilight and I went over all the specifics a while ago and we believe that the transfer should be safe. But neither of us can be one-hundred percent sure what will happen until it… well, happens.”</p><p>My skin flushed red with equal parts anger and stress. “<b>SO, HELP ME, SUNSET! IF I END UP A BLOODY MESS, I’LL</b>—”</p><p>“Rarity, that’s enough,” Flash reprimanded, “I know you’re feeling anxious right now but yelling at Sunset isn’t going to help the situation. If something goes awry, you’ll have the best magical experts in their world on hand to fix the problem. Let’s try to be civil about this, ok?” </p><p>I felt like a complete fool. “I’m terribly sorry, dear. I didn’t mean to snap at you.”</p><p>Sunset wrapped me in a sidearm hug and kissed my cheek. “I know. You’re just not used to dealing with magical situations and this is scary for you. But Flash is right. There are plenty of ponies who’ll be able to help us if shit hits the fan. I don’t think it will, but it’s nice to know that we have options. Do you need a tissue or anything?” </p><p>“No, I’m fine thank you.”</p><p>My nerves were calmed for a time, but my pulse began racing once again when Flash finally parked the car next to the statue. I’m glad that Sunset held my hand when we exited our seats because my gait was wobbly and unsure. Walking on hard pavement in only your bare feet is never a pleasant experience but I endured it with grit and determination. It was only a few steps, after all. When I looked up at the statue, it didn’t appear any different than normal. However, when I placed my hand upon the surface, it rippled and made a strange, fluctuating sound. </p><p>I pulled my hand back and gasped. “Has the portal been turned on?” </p><p>Sunset nodded. “Yep. Princess Twilight devised a way to make it work all the time now.” </p><p>“Well, I suppose we might as well get this over with. In for a penny, in for a pound as they say.”</p><p>Before we stepped through the portal, however, Sunset made sure to give Flash a very passionate goodbye kiss. Part of me felt guilty for watching such an intimate moment unfold. Yet, along with that guilt came a mixture of melancholic regret. I’d only mentioned being gone for a little while due to my powers instead of visiting Braeburn directly. Just to be clear: I did tell Braeburn that I loved him but not in the same, dramatic fashion as Sunset had done with Flash. </p><p>When they finally broke apart, Sunset stepped through the portal without a shred of hesitation. I, on the other hand, stood in the pale moonlight, legs trembling, heart pounding. It took every ounce of willpower that I possessed not to vomit all over the pavement. Upon swallowing the lump that had begun to form in my throat, I took a few shaky steps forward, closed my eyes, and proceeded through the portal at full tilt. Hopefully, I would come back out in one piece.  </p><hr/><p>The experience of having your entire body reshaped in an instant is both terrifying and fascinating at the same time. What did it feel like, you ask? Well, I can’t say that it was painful… but more like my skin was being stretched and compressed simultaneously. Somewhat like an extreme form of yoga, I suppose. I could instantly tell that I was a quadruped when my hooves gently clopped on the marble floor. Oddly enough, my new body felt natural to me. As if I’d always been a pony since birth. Given how disorientated Princess Twilight was when she first arrived, I suspect my experience was completely different because the opal had fused with me. </p><p>Near as I could tell, I was in some sort of annex that was specifically designed to house the mirror portal. Before I had the chance to look around further, Princess Twilight and Sunset cantered over to where I was standing and greeted me with warm smiles. I’d never seen either of them in their original forms and I have to say, they looked positively adorable! Like mythical creatures any seven-year-old girl would love to have at their birthday party.  </p><p>Princess Twilight raised her hoof. I bumped it with my own. How I knew to do that, I’m not sure. “Welcome to Equestria, Rarity! I hope the trip over wasn’t too jarring for you.”</p><p>“It was certainly an interesting experience, your Highness.” </p><p>The alicorn fluffed her wings awkwardly. “Please, just call me Twilight. I’m not real big on titles and—um—you’re technically not one of my subjects anyway.”</p><p>“If that is what you wish, I shall abide. Pardon my frankness, darling but would it be too much trouble to fetch a mirror? I’m rather curious to see what I look like as a pony.” </p><p>“Sure! Follow me please.” </p><p>The three of us walked down the hallway of what I can only assume was a school. There were plenty of young ponies (<i>foals?</i>) going about their business, heading to class, and a few other creatures too. Such as: dragons, yaks, griffons, and even hippogriffs. I was genuinely surprised to see so much diversity amongst the student populace. I always assumed that Equestria was a nation-state that catered specifically to ponies and no one else. I cantered over to Sunset and nudged her flank with my own to try and get her attention discreetly. </p><p>“Where are we exactly? I thought Equestria was the exclusive domain of ponies.” </p><p>Sunset chuckled. “That used to be the case for quite some time, but we’re in the <i>School of Friendship</i>. Erm—allow me to explain: Princess Twilight decided that it would be a good idea to start a school that was open to all species.”</p><p>“Ah~ What a wonderful idea! You’ll have to excuse me for staring so much… I’m simply not used to seeing so many mythical creatures in one place. I feel as though I’ve been transported directly into the pages of a children’s storybook.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it. Everyone here is super friendly and understanding.”</p><p>Princess Twilight gestured towards a wooden door that had a pink, female symbol over it. As in the standard representation of Venus on earth. How odd. I’m not sure how that was even possible, since the Greeks wouldn’t have existed to invent the symbol in this world. Perhaps, it was just one of those coincidental quirks of reality that parallel universes shared? Who knows? With a shrug, I entered the room, and sure enough, there was a large mirror near the sinks. </p><p>When I looked at what I’d become, I expected to see an alien creature stare back at me. However, that wasn’t the case at all. In fact, many of my features had carried over. My mane and tail were set in the same style and color when I was still human. My coat was a very similar shade to what my skin had been, but it was glossier and sparkled like crystal. Quite fetching, I must admit. I didn’t have a horn or wings, so I assumed that I must be what Sunset referred to as an Earth Pony or a subspecies thereof. I wasn’t sure if coloration made a difference in that regard. I’d have to ask the princess. </p><p>I turned sideways and discovered that I had an honest to goodness Cutie Mark branded upon my flanks. It was a set of three golden rings interlocked with each other and had a single diamond placed within the center. I honestly couldn’t tell you what it meant. From what Sunset had told me earlier, she said that they represented a pony’s passion in life, their destiny. She also mentioned that they could, oftentimes, be very symbolic. </p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted Twilight scribbling down notes on a writing pad that appeared out of nowhere. After a few more moments of scribbling and intense staring, I blushed slightly when she stuck her snout underneath my barrel and got a little too close to my nether region for comfort. Seriously! Do ponies have no concept of personal space?  </p><p>“Do you mind? I’m not some purebred on display at the dog show!” </p><p>Twilight’s entire face turned beet red. “<b>SORRY</b>! I got a bit carried away with my observations. Ehehe. You have to understand that Crystal Ponies are pretty rare around these parts. I—erm—was just studying all the differences between you and our Rarity. It’s extremely fascinating!”</p><p>I raised my brow. “I’m glad you found my lady bits so interesting.”</p><p>The flustered princess gave me, what I can only describe, as the most awkward smile I’d ever seen followed by a snorting giggle. “I-I mean, that wasn’t my—<b>THEY LOOK VERY HEALTHY</b>, erm—that is to say: there’s nothing wrong with them at all! Nope!” </p><p>I couldn’t help but laugh at her expense a little. “I should certainly hope so. After all, I go to great lengths to keep my body in tip-top shape. I assume my Equestrian counterpart feels much the same way about her own physique?” </p><p>Twilight nodded vigorously. “Yeah. Again, I’m sorry for—ah—observing your genitalia with such intensity. Sometimes, I can get a little carried away when studying new things and I… forget to use common sense.”</p><p>“No harm done. I suppose I should feel flattered that a Princess complimented me.” </p><p>Twilight rubbed the back of her neck and blushed. “Sure. Let’s go with that…” </p><p>After taking a quick tinkle break, we made our way down the hall towards the canteen to grab a bite for lunch. Judging by the clocks hanging on the wall (<i>again, they used Roman numerals</i>), it was nearly lunchtime. Sunset wasn’t kidding about the time dilation. Although, I wasn’t entirely sure what the exact difference was by comparison. I slowed down my pace so that I could have a private word with Sunset. Something about Twilight’s reaction seemed a bit… unusual to me. I used my hoof to gently tap Sunset on the back. </p><p>“What was all that about in the restroom?” I asked. </p><p>“If I had to guess, I’d say that Twilight’s into mares. Um… more specifically, I think she’s got a <b>MASSIVE</b> crush on your counterpart. She never mentioned it to me before but judging by the way she reacted to you, implies years’ worth of repressed feelings. Talk about awkward…” </p><p>My throat suddenly felt dry. “Oh, dear. In retrospect, that explains a lot, actually.” </p><p>“Yeah. I’d hold off on bringing it up with her. Knowing how clueless Twilight is about matters of romance, she probably hasn’t even gotten to the point where she’s fully aware of her feelings for Rarity. Let alone confessing them out loud. Just try to keep things casual if you can.” </p><p>I closed my eyes for a moment and sighed. “Duly noted. Is there anything else I should be made aware of? I’d rather not cause a scandal while I’m here.”  </p><p>“I’m probably not the right mare to ask. I mean, yeah, I talk with Twilight in the journal every once and a while but it’s not like I’m super interested in what goes on around here.”</p><p>I shot her a quizzical expression. “Why not?”</p><p>“Think about it, Rarity. I’m an orphaned unicorn who lives in the human world most of the time. Nearly all of my friends and everyone I care about reside there. Equestria holds no greater meaning to me other than the occasional visit. I know that sounds kinda harsh, but it’s true.” </p><p>My ears folded and I blushed at my apparent faux pas. “I’m terribly sorry, darling. I had no idea that you were an orphan. This just goes to show that I should’ve gotten to know you better. I promise that from now on, I’ll try my best to be a better friend to you, Sunset.”</p><p>Sunset nuzzled my cheek. “Hey, it’s cool. I’m just as guilty of it as you are. But I appreciate the sentiment all the same. Maybe we could even hang out with the girls more often too!” </p><p>I simply nodded in agreement. Unfortunately, life has a way of making one lose touch with former high school girlfriends. Mind you, it’s not always done on purpose … but it happens all the same. The main reason, in my opinion, is that people often go their separate ways after graduating high school and in doing so, it becomes more difficult to meet up with friends. </p><p>Ruminating my own life choices aside, we arrived at the canteen without any issue, save for a few curious looks. I can’t honestly say that I was hungry enough to eat a full meal, but a cup of coffee and a snack would go a long way to making me feel more comfortable in this alien land. Twilight ordered a burger and what she called “Hay Fries” (<i>they didn’t look very appetizing to me</i>), Sunset a cup of tea, and a caramel latte with almond biscotti for me. We sat together at a table over by one of the windows that offered a lovely view of the courtyard. </p><p>While I was sipping on my latte (<i>don’t ask me how I was able to grip a mug with hooves, I have no idea</i>), Princess Twilight proceeded to devour her burger with the gusto of a competitive eater. Ketchup, Mustard, and little bits of… food, fell onto her tray in a goopy mess. I tried my best to act like it wasn’t a big deal but heavens above! She had the dining etiquette of a swine! Truly, I felt embarrassed for her if this was a regular occurrence. I blushed and cleared my throat. </p><p>“Pardon my frankness, darling. But—um—do you always eat your meals that way?” </p><p>Snout covered in sauce, Twilight looked at me and offered a sheepish smile. “I love hayburgers!” </p><p>“Yes, I can see that.”</p><p>Sunset levitated a napkin over to her face and wiped it clean. “I think what Rarity is trying to say: is that you should probably pay more attention to your table manners in public. Like it or not, you’re royalty now. Just think what the press would do if they caught you eating like one of Applejack’s pigs. It could cause an international scandal.” </p><p>Twilight clopped her hooves together and chuckled. “Funny you should mention that…”  </p><p>I groaned and massaged my temples when she produced said newspaper article. “Really now? I can’t imagine that being called “<i>Burger Princess</i>” is particularly flattering.”</p><p>“What? Nocreature seems to have any issue with the way I eat. In fact, whenever I travel, I get free food! See! Here’s my platinum card. It’s the same with Princess Celestia. She gets cake sent to her all the time. As for Princess Luna, I’m not so sure. You know, come to think of it, I don’t believe I’ve ever asked her what kind of stuff she enjoys drinking or eating…” </p><p>I let out an exasperated sigh. “This is, without a doubt, one of the most ridiculous things I’ve ever witnessed. But I shouldn’t jump to conclusions. Equestria is a different world, after all.” </p><p>Without missing a beat, Twilight proceeded to wolf down her hayfries. I shrugged and dipped my biscotti into the mug whilst taking a dainty bite from the end. We finished our respective meals in silence and moved onto Twilight’s office. I just found it odd how a princess could also be the headmistress of a school but, once again, I realized that I should stop applying human standards to other races and keep an open mind instead. She motioned for me to lay down on a couch, and pulled out a larger version of the notepad she’d been using earlier. </p><p>“Before we begin the thaumatic testing phase, I need to conduct a preliminary investigation. Essentially, a list compiling all of your known abilities, so that we can get an accurate picture of what we’re dealing with. All in the name of safety and science, of course!”</p><p>I tapped my chin in thought. “I’ll try my best to give you as many details as I can, but please bear in mind that I am not an Equestrian native. Magic is not something I’m accustomed to.” </p><p>“Not to worry; I understand. The human world doesn’t have much magic to begin with. Just try your best to be as detailed as possible, Rarity. Even if you may think a particular detail is mundane.”</p><p>“Very well then. For starters, I am able to manipulate minerals and metals with nary a thought. Since I’m a jewelry maker, these abilities have proven a boon to my business. There is also the matter of changing the durability of my skin to become as hard as crystal. I only used that one briefly and have not tested it as extensively as the jewelry crafting.” </p><p>Twilight scribbled something down on her pad. “To what degree can you manipulate everything?”</p><p>“Whatever way I want. Which includes but is not limited to melting, reshaping, and fusion. As for the skin texture… I’m not sure. I have yet to explore its potential properly.” </p><p>Twilight’s wings twitched excitedly. “Absolutely fascinating! I don’t think you realize just how rare and powerful your abilities are. Most ponies who have a talent for metalworking are proficient at understanding how metals behave under certain conditions. But I’ve never heard of anycreature able to melt and cast objects by pure willpower alone or dermal-morphing.”</p><p>I frowned. “Dermal-morphing? Is there really such a term?” </p><p>“Yes. It applies to cockatrices for the most part. Their magical gaze can turn creatures into solid stone. What about you? I assume your ability must be different somehow.” </p><p>My stomach began to churn and I felt clammy with nervous sweat all over. What if Sunset was right? Was I some kind of magical superbeing now? Blast! This is exactly what I’d feared from the very beginning. Believe me, I wanted to scream and throw the biggest tantrum the world has ever seen but that would have only been cathartic for my own benefit. A proper lady faced adversity with a stiff upper lip and unshakable resolve. Tubs of Rocky Road ice cream too.  </p><p>“From what I remember from mythology, a cockatrice turns their victims into solid stone. However, that is not the case with me. My skin seems to retain all of its elasticity and sensations with the properties of crystal. I suppose you could say that I have the best of both worlds.”</p><p>Sunset reached over and placed her hoof over mine while Twilight busied herself with more notetaking. “Everything will be ok, I promise. We’ll get through this somehow.” </p><p>My ears folded downward while I peered into the empty coffee mug. “Thank you, darling. I appreciate all of the support you’ve shown me thus far. I’m terribly sorry for freaking out so much about this whole situation but these powers of mine are a great responsibility to bear. I shan’t lie to you; it will be difficult for me to manage them. What do I tell my family? Can I even tell them in the first place? I don’t know what to do!” </p><p>“They already know about your geode, don’t they?” </p><p>I waved my hoof. “In a very general sense. You must understand that my powers, compared to the rest of the girls, aren’t flashy like Rainbow Dash’s super speed or Pinkie’s exploding cupcakes. I didn’t see the point in making a big fuss over them. I don’t… enjoy that kind of attention. I just wanted to lead a relatively normal life, free from mystical drama.” </p><p>Sunset nodded in understanding while Twilight gave me a wing-hug of sorts. “I felt much the same way as you when I first ascended, Rarity. You’re right, though. Power is both a choice and a responsibility. There are times when I still wonder if I was the right mare for the job…”</p><p>“What do you think, darling? Will you be able to help me figure what’s going on?” </p><p>Twilight sighed. “I’m afraid it’s not that simple. The kind of magic we’re dealing with is rare and, quite frankly, obscure to modern spellcasters. Including myself. At the very least, I think we’ll need to call in some experts before any practical testing can be done.”</p><p>“What kind of experts do you have in mind?”</p><p>Sunset leaned back in her chair. “What about the Crystal Empire? That sounds like a great place to start. Considering that Rarity seems to be a crystal pony and all.” </p><p>“I agree but we might need more than what they have to offer. You see, a lot of ancient records were either destroyed or lost during King Sombra’s reign. Plus, we don’t know how old the artifact Rarity absorbed actually was. It could even predate the Empire. Tell you what: I’ll contact Cadence and see if she’ll let us visit the place for a few days. I’ll also send a scroll out to Dragon Lord Ember and ask if her father would be willing to share any information too.”  </p><p>Sunset’s brow furrowed in confusion. “Lord Torch? Why would we ask him?”</p><p>“Because he’s one of the oldest living creatures on the entire planet. Yes, he’s even older than Luna and Celestia. I—erm—asked the princess one time. What? Don’t give me that look! I was just a filly at the time. You can’t blame me for being curious.” </p><p>Sunset laughed. “I can totally see that happening. In all seriousness though, how old is he?” </p><p>“I seem to recall that he’s pushing six-thousand? I’ll have to ask Spike. He’s been in contact with the Dragon Lands more frequently than I have.”</p><p>“Spike,” I asked, “As in the dog you brought along with you?”</p><p>“Mhmm. He’s actually a dragon. I also appointed him as Equestria’s first, official ambassador to Dragonkind. Before Dragon Lord Ember came along, we didn’t have any diplomatic relations with them at all. Dragons aren’t exactly the most hospitable race…” </p><p>I clopped my hooves together. “Good for him. Is there any chance I might meet Spike again at some point? He seemed to enjoy my company and I was rather fond of him as well.”</p><p>“If there’s time. I apologize if we’re skipping all of the usual pleasantries, but I don’t want to keep you two here any longer than necessary.”</p><p>I nodded. “Duly noted. We’re in your capable hooves, then.”</p>
