		<h1>Leaving A Lasting Impression At The Gala</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 4</b></p><p>Orange Manor, Manehatten </p><p>About a half hour before the doors to Orange Manor opened and all of the guests would start the Charity Gala in earnest, I roamed the halls trying to find out where Braeburn was. As fate would have it, I ran into another Apple Family member while passed by the dining room. Unlike her usual tomboyish getup, Applejack was wearing a beautiful red silk dress that went down to her ankles. A pair of apple-shaped, ruby earrings complimented her stylish bun. I could tell that she had worn a little bit of make-up but it was only enough to accentuate what was already there. </p><p>With a wide grin, I padded over to my best friend and awaited her reaction. Rather than saying a word, Applejack’s eyebrow about raised up to the ceiling. She stared at me for a good thirty seconds before shaking her head and wrapping me up in an affectionate hug. </p><p>“What in tarnation are ya wearin’, Rares? Or rather, lack thereof…” </p><p>I giggled. “Body paint for the most part and a few pieces of jewelry. Do you like it?”</p><p>“Uh… it’s somthin’ alright.” </p><p>“What’s wrong, darling? Do you think the colors are off or—”</p><p>Applejack sighed. “It ain’t that at all. Rarity, fer all intents and purposes, yer practically buck nekkid right now. Now before ya get all righteous with me, I know that’s how ya prefer ta go about yer business. But c’mon! Are ya seriously gonna go out like that?” </p><p>“Applejack, while I sincerely appreciate your concern, I’ve already made up my mind. This is the perfect way to attract attention towards the auction piece and, by extension, promote my jewelry shop. Just think of all the publicity!”</p><p>Applejack suddenly walked behind me and gave my bottom a firm smack. I yelped in response. “Oh yeah? And I’ll bet every feller who’s got a pulse will be noticin’ yer bare ass n’ boobies jigglin’ around too. I know yer not a hussy, Rares. But some folks might get the wrong idea.”</p><p>I couldn’t help but blush slightly. “Yes, well I’ve already taken that into account. And you know what? I could care less what they think! It’s my body and I’m damn proud of it. If they don’t like me showing it off, then they can kiss my pearly-white derriere!”</p><p>“Heh. Be careful what ya wish for, Rares. Ah imagine some fellers might take ya up on that offer. Anywho… what can Ah do ya fer? Can’t imagine yer lookin’ fer a snack.” </p><p>I cleared my throat. “I was looking for Braeburn. Have you seen him lately?” </p><p>“Last Ah seen ‘im, Brae was settin’ up the bar with a few bottles o’ whiskey. He won’t be the one pourin’ the drinks tonight, o’ course. Mah Aunt’s got that covered. Ya plannin’ on takin’ ‘im along as yer plus two? ‘Cause if ya are, it’d make me feel a helluva lot better.” </p><p>I nodded. “I was, as a matter of fact. And my own thoughts mirror yours. I feel safe around him and I do believe he shall do his best to protect my honor from scallywags and ne’er-do-wells.”</p><p>Applejack laughed. “Reckon he will. Seriously, though. Keep safe. Ah don’t want ta see ya get hurt or taken advantage of, ya hear? A gal like ya doesn’t deserve that kind o’ trouble.” </p><p>I kissed her on the cheek. “Don’t worry! I know how to handle myself should the situation run awry. I can’t imagine a potential molester would expect me to be an expert in Judo.”</p><p>“And a crazy, nekkid Aztec priestess ta boot. Alrighty then, Rares. Go on n’ find mah cousin.”</p><p>I waved goodbye to Applejack and made my way to the bar as she suggested. In no time at all, I found my beau. He was dressed in a dashing, black tuxedo with a rose pinned to the pocket. He had also slicked back his hair for the occasion. I thought he looked every bit the part of a handsome gentleman meant to escort a noble lady. While Braeburn was turned away, I snuck up behind him and wrapped my arms around his torso, locking him in a surprise hug. </p><p>“Guess who?” I whispered into his ear whilst nibbling on it playfully. </p><p>“Rarity, is that you?”</p><p>“The one and only, darling~ How are you doing this fine evening?”</p><p>When he finally turned around to see me, his eyes widened in disbelief. I’m quite certain that he felt my breasts press up against his back, despite wearing clothes himself. He took a few steps back, face flushed, and tried to come up with an intelligible response. I made sure to twirl around so that he could get a good look at my body from every angle (<i>and to allow certain assets to jiggle around a bit as Applejack had so bluntly pointed out</i>). Even though it was adorable watching him blush like that, I really wanted to get an answer from him. </p><p>“So… what do you think of my ‘<i>outfit</i>’ for the Charity Gala?” </p><p>Braeburn coughed awkwardly. “Fer Pete’s sake, Rarity! Yer practically nekkid!!” </p><p>“Come now, Braeburn. It’s not like you haven’t seen me without clothing on before.” </p><p>Braeburn twiddled his fingers together. “Yeah, but this is different. We’re in public and—uh—people are gonna see ya. Lots of people, Ah might add!”</p><p>“Yes, I know that.”</p><p>Braeburn carefully placed his hand atop my shoulder. “Ah obviously can’t force ya ta make decisions, Rarity. That’s fer ya ta decide. But Ah want ya ta know that Ah don’t think this is a very bright idea. What if… ya get taken advantage of? Ah ain’t a city boy, but even I know there’s bound ta be paparazzi and unscrupulous characters here tonight.” </p><p>“I already put a lot of consideration into this decision, Braeburn. I’m well aware of all the risks involved. Rest assured, I am quite capable of taking care of myself and handling the sort of players that shall be present here tonight. However, I’m very touched by your concern.” </p><p>Braeburn caressed my cheeks and planted a gentle kiss upon my lips. “Ah just don’t wanna see ya get hurt is all. Ah care about ya a whole lot, Rarity.” </p><p>My heart fluttered in my chest. “Your cousin said something along the same lines. To that end, would you mind accompanying me as my official date tonight? I’d like for us to have some fun together and relax, if possible. Would you do me the honor, Braeburn?” </p><p>He bowed politely and offered his arm. I took it without hesitation and we began to make our way towards the entrance of Orange Manor where all of the guests would be arriving. While we walked down the hall, I glanced over at him discreetly, in order to gauge his reaction. Sure enough, his eyes were roaming all over my paint-clad body from top to bottom. A warm, tingling sensation filled my loins. Braeburn’s obvious interest made me feel incredibly sexy~ </p><p>“Like what you see, darling?” I breathed in a husky whisper. </p><p>Braeburn blushed. “Sorry fer starin’ at ya so much. Ah just…” </p><p>I giggled. “There’s no shame in admitting that you’re having thoughts of a more lascivious nature, Braeburn. In fact, feel free to look at my body as much as you want from now on. I truly don’t mind. But remember: always ask permission first before you touch a lady~” </p><p>“Fair enough. Ya look breath takin’, Rarity. Really accentuates all o’ yer curves and whatnot. It’ll be hard fer me ta keep mah thoughts straight if I’m next ta ya all night long.”</p><p>I nearly lost my composure and let out a girlish squeal. Braeburn was such an honest boy. But that was one of the many things I loved about him. “I’m glad you like it so much. I’m sure that everyone else will too. What about my perfume? Is it too much?”</p><p>“Nah, it’s fine. Smells really good too. What kind is it?” </p><p>Some women like to drown themselves in the stuff. I, on the other hand, take a more conservative approach. Just a few dabs in strategic areas: like my armpits, neck, underneath my breasts, and in-between my thighs. Areas that tend to get a bit sweaty. Please don’t get the wrong impression. I most certainly <b>DID NOT</b> have any issues with body odor. A lady such as myself takes great pride in smelling her best. Although, I’d read somewhere that those areas had higher concentrations of pheromones. Might as well cover all my bases. </p><p>“Just my usual blend. Vanilla and rose oil.”</p><p>Braeburn offered me his hand, to which I took with pleasure. “Suits ya. Shall we go then? Ah imagine you’ll be the star attraction of this here Gala. Everybody’ll wanna talk to ya.” </p><p>“You said it yourself, darling. My ‘<i>outfit</i>’ is rather eye-catching. If at any point you feel overwhelmed by it all, please let me know. That way we can go retreat somewhere quiet and have a little alone time together. Does that sound amenable to you?” </p><p>Braeburn merely nodded in reply. With everything going on tonight, I could tell that he was very anxious. And yes, I realized that I was a contributing factor towards his discomfort. Still, it made me very happy that he appreciated all of the hard work that had been put into my ‘<i>outfit</i>’. I took a deep, shuddering breath to try and calm myself before we made our grand entrance. </p><hr/><p>Even though I’d been amongst large groups of people before at naturist resorts, it had never been under these specific circumstances. And most certainly not with a boyfriend in tow. That was something I had never managed to work up the courage to do during my youth. Knowing my father as I do, he would have never allowed two teenagers alone together, and for the most part, unsupervised at a naturist resort. It probably all worked out for the best, if I’m being honest. </p><p>My heart pounded in my chest and my legs felt like rubber. As Pinkie would say: “<i>I was nervouscited</i>.” Technically, my naughty bits were covered up from prying eyes and camera lenses but… it essentially felt the same as being nude. My very first foray into the world of high stakes business was putting my body on full display in front of Manehatten’s rich and powerful. Suddenly, I could feel the breeze tickling my bare skin as we walked into the courtyard. </p><p>Oh drat! Why did <i>that</i> have to happen now of all times?! Erm—allow me to explain. You see, I have an awful habit of sweating like a pig whenever I become nervous. Since I wasn’t wearing any clothing, the effect wasn’t all that noticeable. However, there was one area of my body, primarily in-between my butt cheeks, that would never fail to become drenched in sweat. </p><p>The uncomfortable, clammy feeling of having a wet bottom was terribly distracting. I was glad that the paint did a good job at concealing my normally fair complexion. Otherwise, the rosy blush coloring nearly my entire body would have been visible to everyone. Braeburn seemed to pick up on this, bless his heart, and looked at me with an expression of concern. I tried my best to put on a brave face, but it wasn’t enough. </p><p>“What’s wrong, Rarity? Are ya havin’ second thoughts about all this?” </p><p>I let out a frustrated groan. “Well, I am a bit more nervous than I thought I’d be. But—ah—it’s a different issue than that, I’m afraid. One of a rather… personal nature.”</p><p>“Anythin’ Ah can do ta help?” </p><p>I frowned. “Not unless you have a washcloth that I could stick up my bum.”   </p><p>Braeburn blinked owlishly. “Uh… beg pardon?” </p><p>“If you must know, my butt crack is starting to get all sweaty!” I hissed. </p><p>“Oh. OH! Well, that’s—hahaha—Ah didn’t realize women had that problem.” </p><p>“Of course, we can—ugh! I really don’t need this tonight. Curse my nervous habit! I’m sorry for being so cross, darling. It’s just a very uncomfortable feeling. But at least I don’t have to deal with getting a wedgie at the same time. That would simply be the worst!”</p><p>Braeburn reached over and rubbed my back. “Do you—erm—need me ta get ya some papers towels ta… dry it up or somethin’?”</p><p>“No. That won’t be necessary. I’ll let my sweat dry out naturally. I suspect that it shall take a while, but I don’t want to look like an idiot, constantly wiping my bottom with paper towels or the like. Thank you for the offer, though. I really do appreciate your willingness to help me.” </p><p>Braeburn flashed me an encouraging smile. “Yer welcome.” </p><p>It hadn’t escaped my notice that Braeburn placed his hand upon my hip while we continued to walk. He caressed my skin gently, as a way to help me calm down and show his support. Most couples might not make a fuss over such a gesture, but I felt that it was a significant step in our relationship. He was starting to get more comfortable showing physical affection towards me, even though I was clad in little more than paint. This was a good sign. Especially, considering how conservative his family was regarding intimacy. And nudity in general, I suppose. I moved my hand over his and returned the gesture with an affectionate smile of my own.</p><p>With newfound resolve, I focused my attention forward on the other guests. As I expected, a great deal of them ceased their conversations and cast their gaze towards me. Some of the looks I got were far beyond mere curiosity. I could practically sense the naked lust radiating from within their eyes. However, like a proper lady, I merely nodded politely and waved on occasion.</p><p>That said, the vast majority of guests seemed genuinely impressed by Sombra’s handiwork (<i>and my own too</i>). From what I understand, he is a rather famous artist with a legendary reputation amongst those in the know. I wasn’t at all familiar with his work prior to tonight, but I promised myself to peruse some of his pieces when I had the chance. </p><p>After sweating so much, my mouth felt as dry as a bone. So, I left Braeburn to chat with a few of the guests while I scampered over to the buffet table for some liquid refreshments. While I was enjoying a delicious fuzzy navel, I nearly choked when I saw who was standing next to me. It was none other than Countess Coloratura herself! She wasn’t wearing any of her usual, over the top outfits, but rather a simple navy dress that went down past her knees. A cute pair of white slippers accented the rose she wore in her hair. Elegant and to the point. I liked it. </p><p>“Enjoying the Gala so far, Miss Rarity?” she asked politely. </p><p>“Bwuh?”</p><p>The Countess giggled. “Oh, I’m sorry! Applejack talks about you so much that I forgot we’ve never met in person before. You can just call me Rara if you want.”</p><p>I hesitantly shook her hand. “Good evening, Rara. I’ve always been a big fan of your music! So—erm—what exactly has Applejack told you about me? Only good things, I hope! AHAHAHA!”</p><p>Great way to make a first impression, Rarity. Acting like a starstruck buffoon. </p><p>“Lots of good things! I must say, I’m really digging the getup you’ve got there. The necklace looks like it came straight out of a Daring Do novel. Did you make that yourself?”</p><p>I cleared my throat. “Indeed. I designed all of the jewelry myself. Mr. Sombra was the one who created my ‘<i>outfit</i>’ as it were. You can take a closer look if you’d like. I don’t mind.”</p><p>Rara did just that and traced her fingers along my chest. With a slight blush, she pulled them back and suddenly found a plate full of swiss cheese cubes to be the most interesting thing in the world. Had she somehow thought I’d been offended? I took another sip of my fuzzy navel and nibbled on a slice of smoked salmon. When the awkward silence stretched on for more than thirty seconds, I decided to ask her what was the matter.</p><p>“What’s wrong, darling? Are you not feeling well?”</p><p>Rara shuffled her feet. “I didn’t realize you were only wearing paint. That means…” </p><p>“I am essentially walking around in the nude right now? Yes, I know. Believe me, I do. It’s a bold strategy for advertising my brand, but I think it will pay off in the end. What do you think?” </p><p>Rara looked at me again. “I think you look absolutely stunning, Miss Rarity. Don’t get me wrong; I’m a girl who loves her crazy costumes, but I don’t think I’d ever be brave enough to pull something like that off. Takes some real guts. And a great body too…” </p><p>It was my turn to blush. “Thank you, dear. I appreciate the compliment.”  </p><p>Rara nodded demurely. “No problem. I guess it’s like the old saying goes: ‘<i>If you’ve got it, flaunt it</i>’. Nobody’s given you any trouble over your… costume yet, have they? Most of the people here are pretty open-minded but Manehatten has its share of perverted creeps.”</p><p>“Not yet, thank goodness. But I have received some wantonly lewd stares. In a sense, it should make me happy that my body is attractive enough to do so but… ugh! It’s complicated. I only want one man to look at me that way. To have… lewd thoughts about me.” </p><p>Rara’s tone suggested that she was disappointed somehow. “Oh. Who might that be?” </p><p>“Applejack’s cousin, Braeburn. He and I have been acquainted for several years. Before I moved to Manehatten, I’d been far too busy to pursue a relationship. But now, I feel like my life has stabilized enough for me to get back onto the market. Well, briefly anyway.” </p><p>“I only met Braeburn a few times. He seemed nice enough, though. Handsome too.” </p><p>I let out a dreamy sigh. “All of those things and more.” </p><p>Rara let out a dejected sigh after taking a swig of her martini. “Must be nice being in love…” </p><p>“Pardon? Oh… I hadn’t realized that you were—”</p><p>The countess munched on the olive floating in her drink. “Single? Yeah. It’s tough dating anyone who’s impartial when you’re as famous as I am. It’s funny, you know. I’m surrounded by adoring fans, but I still feel like there’s this big, gaping hole in my life. I’m sorry, Miss Rarity. I didn’t mean to bring up such a dour topic. I just—being lonely really sucks.” </p><p>I patted her back. “Perhaps, I could be of assistance?” </p><p>“How so?”</p><p>I nibbled on another cheese cube. Oh! Cheddar. “Assuming that you’re attracted to women, I have a certain fashion-savvy friend who’s cute, single, and ready to mingle~ She’s—um—how shall we say, a bit skittish around strangers though. Very shy and introverted.”</p><p>“How’d you guess that I was a—” </p><p>I snorted. “My dear, as a jewelry designer, I have an eye for fine details. Which can just as easily be applied to people as well. The way I see it: your body language thus far, has spoken volumes about what your proclivities are. Not to worry; I’m not judging you or anything.” </p><p>Rara blushed profusely, which I thought was rather adorable but I kept my mouth shut. “I wasn’t lying when I said you had a great body, Rarity. There’s gonna be a lot of women here who’ll be jealous that you’re showing it off so causally too. WELL! Now that we’ve addressed the pink elephant in the room, let’s talk about this shy friend of yours.” </p><p>“Indeed. Her name is Coco Pommel. She’s a fashion designer living in the city. Born and raised in Baltimare, but as I said before: she has a few issues with keeping her anxiety under control. The poor dear is prone to having panic attacks whenever she gets stressed out sometimes.” </p><p>“Aww. That’s unfortunate. Do you think she’d be too nervous to have a chat with me?” </p><p>I shrugged. “Honestly, I have no idea. She never mentioned listening to your music before. The only thing I would suggest is try to be as patient as you can with her. It might take a little while, but once you gain Coco’s trust, she’ll open up to you. I promise.”</p><p>Rara’s expression brightened. “Is she here at the Gala?” </p><p>“I believe so. Hold on a moment, darling. Let me go bother my boyfriend for a moment. As you might well imagine, my ‘<i>outfit</i>’ fits like a glove and is extremely comfortable, but it wasn’t designed to carry anything.” </p><p>Braeburn was busy nursing a pint of ale and a handful of crackers when I politely asked him if I could borrow his phone for a moment so that I could text Coco. I had no idea where she was currently and wanted her to meet Rara right away. He was about to ask why I didn’t have mine on hand, when I danced in place to make everything jiggle a bit. With a sheepish blush, he dug into his pocket and fished out a very plain-looking smartphone. I rewarded him with a kiss. </p><p>Once I finished texting her, I returned to Rara. “She’s on her way as we speak. As it turns out, she was taking a little break from the crowd in the gardens.”</p><p>The gardens weren’t very far away from the main reception area, so Coco arrived within minutes. She was wearing a beautiful strapless dress, black velvet with sequins. Coco walked carefully due to the black stilettos gracing her feet, and her hair was set in its usual, pristine bob-cut. When she finally saw Rara and I together at the buffet table, her eyes widened in shock. In a stumbling gait, she rushed over to me, grabbed my arm, and pulled me aside. </p><p>“Rarity, what on earth are you wearing?! That looks like—OH NO… you can’t be serious. You’re wearing nothing but a little bit of jewelry and paint! WHY?!!” </p><p>I placed my hand on her shoulder. “Relax, dear. It’s all part of my plan.”</p><p>“Plan? What plan? You mean the one where everyone thinks you’re an exhibitionist?” </p><p>I let out a heavy sigh. “No, I assure you that I have everything under control. I wanted to draw attention to the auction piece. And what better way to do that than model it myself?” </p><p>Coco huffed in frustration. “Maybe that part was a good idea, at least. But why did you have to show up in nothing but paint? Even as a naturist, you should know that people aren’t going to keep their eyes fixed on the necklace alone. What about your reputation? You’re practically walking around buck-naked at Manehatten’s most famous charity event!”</p><p>“Yes, I know.” </p><p>Coco began to hyperventilate and hugged me tightly. “Please don’t be do anything rash like this ever again, Rarity. You’re my best friend and I love you. I don’t want to see you get hurt or taken advantage of.”</p><p>I kissed her forehead. “I love you too, darling. Just about everyone else who’s important in my life has told me how thoughtless it was to do this. But I have no regrets! Sometimes, putting your brand out there incurs risk. Thus far, however, I’ve received mostly positive feedback.” </p><p>Coco seemed to calm down a bit. “Well, to be fair, you do pull off the whole: sexy, Aztec priestess look flawlessly. I’ll bet Braeburn was practically slobbering over you, huh?” </p><p>“For the most part,” I admitted, “Like I said: you needn’t worry about me so much. I can handle myself, and with Braeburn by my side, I’ve made it very clear that I’m spoken for. Now, might we discuss the actual reason why I asked you to come see me?” </p><p>Coco twirled a strand of her hair. “Sure. Who did you want me to meet?” </p><p>“Before you go meet her, I have to warn you: she’s somewhat of a celebrity.” </p><p>Coco bit her lip. “Rarity, I don’t need any more stress right now…” </p><p>“Are you, by chance, familiar with Countess Coloratura?” </p><p>“Of course, I am. She writes great music and has an amazing sense of fashion. Why are you—wait a second! You can’t possibly be serious! She’s here?! NOW?!!” </p><p>I chuckled and tried to act nonchalant. “Erm—well—yes, darling. I might have mentioned that you share many of the same interests and also happen to be single right now, so—”</p><p>“<b>A FAMOUS POP STAR IS LOOKING FOR A DATE AND YOU SUGGESTED ME?!!”</b></p><p>Before Coco could have a full-blown panic attack, I grabbed ahold of her head and placed it in-between my breasts like a natural pillow. For some reason, Coco always found this particular type of affection to be therapeutic. This time was no exception. After stroking her hair a few times, she began breathing normally again and seemed to compose herself once more. </p><p>“Everything will be alright, dear. Rara is a normal girl with normal needs just like us, except she happens to be famous. If you need any further proof of this, ask Applejack. They’ve been close friends since childhood. Besides, what exactly do you have to lose by talking to her?” </p><p>Coco sighed. “I guess you have a point. Alright, I’ll go talk to her.” </p><p>I was very pleased to see that Coco caught Rara’s undivided attention while she walked towards the buffet table. The look in both of their eyes when they met was that of genuine interest and curiosity. Although somewhat awkward at first, the two of them were laughing and talking about their favorite music and whatnot like they’d known each other for years. They looked absolutely adorable together! When I was sure that no one else was looking, I squealed to myself. </p><p>Once I regained my lady-like composure, I set off to find Braeburn again and allowed the two of them to have some private time. It didn’t take long before I found my beau. He was chatting with his aunt amongst a few other party-goers and motioned for me to join him. I obliged, of course. It would have been rather rude of me not to. With yet another fuzzy navel in my grasp, I padded over to Braeburn, gave him an affectionate kiss on the cheek, and wrapped my free arm around his waist. I wanted to make it <u>VERY</u> clear to everyone that we were a couple.  </p><p>Dalia took a sip of champagne and smiled. “Rarity, my dear! I was just talking about your fabulous costume and svelte physique. Take a look everyone! Doesn’t she look stunning? And the best part of all: what you see before you is, for the most part, <i>au naturale</i> Rarity Belle.” </p><p>I giggle snorted and nearly choked on my drink. It seems that I was destined to be embarrassed tonight. “Oh, please! Give credit where credit is due, Mrs. Orange. Mister Sombra was the one talented enough to craft such an amazing costume in the first place.” </p><p>“Yes, but you’re the one owning it~ Not to mention, you created all of the jewelry too.”</p><p>Sombra flashed me an award-winning smile and held up his dirty martini. “Mrs. Orange is correct. Art is only as good as the canvas it is painted on. And, if I do say so myself, what a remarkable canvas it is! Truly, you are one of the most beautiful models I have ever had the pleasure to paint. The honor was mine, Miss Rarity.” </p><p>My entire face flushed bright red like a garden-ripe tomato. I could tell that other guests were studying me with great intensity, examining every curve of my body in lurid detail. It was both exhilarating and terribly nerve-wracking all at the same time. The sudden urge to vomit struck me like a wave crashing against a ship in a storm. For a brief moment, I wasn’t entirely certain if I was going to be able to keep down my drink. </p><p>I’ve never felt so ashamed of myself. Save for the day I walked home from school in a tattered dress. For a woman who was supposedly comfortable with her own image, I was terrified that everyone would assume I was a harlot for wearing little more than paint. Would they shun me for adopting such an unconventional lifestyle like my ‘<i>friends</i>’ in grade school did so many years ago? It was an irrational fear, born of childhood trauma, but one that I could not quash easily. </p><p>Luckily, Braeburn noticed that I was feeling overwhelmed and began rubbing my lower back. He apologized to everyone present and insisted that I needed to get some air. So, he ushered me over to a less inhabited corner of the reception area. It took every ounce of my willpower not to curl up into a ball on the floor and sob with reckless abandon. After taking in a few deep breaths, I calmed down a bit. It wasn’t my proudest moment that night. </p><p>“Are ya gonna be ok, Rarity?” </p><p>“Yes, darling. Just give me a moment to compose myself.” I croaked. </p><p>“Hrmmm. Ah don’t like the way some o’ them folks are lookin’ at ya.” </p><p>I sighed. “It’s to be expected, Braeburn. I’m literally the showpiece.”</p><p>“Maybe so, but… ya ain’t some piece o’ meat ta be drooled over.”   </p><p>I huffed in frustration. “What would you have me do, then? I’ve already made my choice.”</p><p>“Ah dunno. How’s about ya git up on the balcony over yonder and give a speech.” </p><p>I blinked owlishly. “I’m not quite sure I follow…” </p><p>“Tell ‘em how much ya love makin’ jewelry, bein’ generous ta others in need, and most importantly, that ya ain’t afraid ta be yerself. Those kinds o’ things!” </p><p>I looked down at my feet and whimpered. “If only it were that simple! Braeburn, I’ve—public speaking has never been my strongpoint. What if they… ridicule me for being a naturist? I just couldn’t bear it, darling. Not again…” </p><p>Braeburn cupped my cheeks. “Then it’s their loss! There’s absolutely nothin’ wrong with ya, Rarity. All ya gotta do is speak from the heart. Let ‘em know what yer all about. People, no matter what walk o’ life they come from, tend ta respect confidence and sincerity.”</p><p>“You’re right, of course. It's time that I stop trying to hide who I am.”</p><p>Braeburn kissed my forehead. “Don’t worry; I’ll be standin’ right next to ya.” </p><p>I asked Dalia first if it was ok to make a speech regarding the showpiece. She agreed without hesitation and set about transforming the balcony into a makeshift stage. Within ten minutes, everyone had started to gather around, waiting to hear from me. Dalia handed me the microphone and I walked up the stairs carefully with Braeburn at my side. I surveyed the crowd and noticed that everyone appeared curious rather than upset. As good a sign as any, I suppose. </p><p>“Good evening, esteemed guests. My name is Rarity Belle and I’d like to take a moment to introduce both myself and the centerpiece that shall be up for auction. First and foremost, I am a jewelry designer by profession. I own a small shop downtown called: <i>Diamond in The Rough</i>. If you like any of my pieces tonight, please stop by sometime. All are welcome!</p><p>“I’m certain that many of you are wondering why I’ve chosen to appear in body paint. I will admit that this particular costume may seem a bit risqué, but I wanted to embody the spirit of the culture that inspired me to make the pieces. My sincere thanks to Mr. Sombra for doing such a marvelous job! A round of applause for him everyone, if you would please.”</p><p>After the guests stopped clapping, I resumed my speech. “That being said: I have another reason. I was born and raised in a naturist household, so nudity has always been the standard for me. I was taught that the human body is not something to be ashamed of. In fact, it is to be celebrated not matter the shape or size. Some here tonight may believe that I’m simply showing off or that I’m a shameless exhibitionist. I don’t give a damn what they think!</p><p>“I’m proud of my lifestyle too. Every day, I work hard and eat healthy to maintain my figure. There is no miracle pill or secret technique to be had here. It’s all about dedication. I’m also dedicated to providing comfort to those who are desperately in need of it. Whether it is clothing, money, food, shelter, or otherwise. So, yes. Look at me if you want but keep in mind what’s at stake here tonight. Your bids will help people less fortunate than us. Thank you.” </p><p>My entire body shook with nervous energy. It had taken every ounce of my willpower to deliver that speech and I felt emotionally exhausted afterwards. Much to my surprise, everyone seemed to have enjoyed the speech and I found many guests nodding their heads in silent agreement. Quite a few of them even came up to me and asked about my contact information for future commissions. My declaration had gone far better than I’d dare hoped. </p><p>Braeburn smiled at me. “See? Told ya they’d get the message.” </p><p>“Indeed. But to be frank, I’d rather not do that again anytime soon.” </p><p>Sombra walked over to me and kissed my hand. “A wonderful speech, Miss Rarity. I would even go so far as to say that your fiery passion ignited the souls of all present. I’m certain your centerpiece will fetch an astounding sum. If not, I will be sure to bid on it myself.” </p><p>The expression on Braeburn’s face was somewhere between cautious and protective. Sombra was an exceedingly handsome man, after all. So, perhaps Braeburn felt that I was being wooed or something to that effect. It’s true that the artist was both polite and charming, but I never sensed that he had ever been coming onto me. Oh well. Boys will be boys.  </p><p>Before I had a chance to defuse the situation, a rugged looking man in his early forties, dressed in a white tuxedo came over to Sombra and they shared an affectionate kiss together. I had my suspicions about Sombra’s preferences but this confirmed them without a shred of doubt. They looked quite adorable together. In a sort of… machismo homosexual sort of way. </p><p>“<i>Hola mi amigos</i>. I am Dr. Ricardo Caballeron of the Manehatten Institute of Archeology. Juan has told me much about you, Miss Rarity. It is an honor to finally meet you in person.” </p><p>The befuddled expression on Braeburn’s face was priceless. I couldn’t help but giggle. “A pleasure, Doctor. I’ve heard many good things about your expeditions. In fact, one of the documentaries I watched featuring your commentary helped inspire my outfit tonight.” </p><p>“<i>Muy Bueno</i>! It’s always nice to see a fellow enthusiast of Aztec culture. By the way, your necklace looks so authentic that I wouldn’t have been surprised if you’d told me it was a thousand years old. Juan! You simply must bid on it! I want it in our home.” </p><p>Sombra wrapped his arm around Caballeron’s waist and gave him a quick kiss. “Of course, my love. I will make every effort to buy it. That is… if we are not outbid.” </p><p>“<i>Si</i>. Such is life. In any case, Miss Rarity, I will leave you my business card. Even if we do not win the bid tonight, I’m definitely interested in commissioning a piece from you. Enjoy the rest of your evening.” </p><p>I handed the business card over to Braeburn seeing as how I had no pockets in which to place it. We watched as the two of them walked over to the buffet table for some more refreshments and to mingle with the other guests. Upon finishing my second fuzzy navel, I put my hands on my hips and glared at Braeburn. He seemed to wilt in place. </p><p>“There was no reason to give Mr. Sombra the stink eye.” </p><p>Braeburn had the decency to look ashamed. “Rarity, Ah didn’t mean ta—”</p><p>“Come now, darling. Do you think I was born yesterday? I know what jealousy looks like.” </p><p>“Fine. I’ll admit that Ah thought he was… flirtin’ with ya.” </p><p>I pressed my body up against his chest and purred. “Good boy. I like it when you’re honest. While Sombra was indeed handsome, you should know by now that I’m only interested in a certain studly member of the Apple Family~ I wonder who that could be?”</p><p>“Glad ta hear it. Ah was just makin’ sure.” Braeburn mumbled. </p><p>I locked arms with my beau and we took a stroll around the grounds. I wanted to get a little fresh air and clear my mind. We came upon the gardens and I immediately understood why Coco had been drawn to them. They were spectacular! Marble fountains, colorful flora of every type imaginable, neatly trimmed bushes, and a lovely greenhouse in the center of it all. I led Braeburn to a more secluded part of the gardens, away from other people, wrapped my arms around his neck, and kissed him passionately. When we broke apart, I placed my hand on his chest. </p><p>“It’s so romantic out here. Almost like a fairy tale. Would you dance with me, Braeburn?” </p><p>He smiled at me. “Certainly, Miss.” </p><p>That was how we spent the remainder of our evening together. In each other’s embrace, dancing under the pale moonlight. I probably should have attended the auction just to see what my necklace had fetched, but spending time with Braeburn was far more important to me. Besides, I could always just ask Dalia later when I got the chance. </p><p>There was a point where Braeburn took hold of my bottom and gave it a firm squeeze. I was a bit surprised, but I honestly didn’t mind. I thought it was only fair since he’d shown so much self-control around me the entire evening. I was essentially nude, after all. Unfortunately, things abruptly became awkward between us when I felt him fondle my breast. He wasn’t rough about it, mind you, I just wasn’t quite ready to take that step in our relationship yet. I pulled away from him with a heavy heart. The look of disappointment on his face was palpable. </p><p>I shuffled my feet in the grass, unsure of what to say. “I’m sorry, Braeburn.” </p><p>“Ah messed up big time, didn’t Ah?” </p><p>I held his hand and stroked it gently to reassure him. “Not exactly. I suppose it’s partially my fault. I may have gone a bit too far with my flirting and gave you the wrong impression. My lack of attire probably isn’t helping matters either. Now’s just not the right time or place, darling.” </p><p>“Oh. Ah don’t wanna—umm—force ya ta have sex or anythin’…” </p><p>I leaned over and kissed his cheek. “And I appreciate that. For the time being, let’s get to know each other better, romantically, then we’ll see what happens. Rest assured, I am very much interested in making love to you, but I don’t want us to make any rash decisions.”</p><p>“Shit! Yer right. Ah don’t even have a condom on me right now.”</p><p>I giggled. “Precisely my point, darling. Neither of us are prepared right now.”</p><p>Braeburn’s face glowed with an adorable blush. “Could we maybe lie down in the grass, watch the moon, and snuggle fer a bit instead? I’d like that.” </p><p>“Certainly. I’d like that too.”</p>
