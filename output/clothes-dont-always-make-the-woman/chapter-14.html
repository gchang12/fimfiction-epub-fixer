		<h1>An Interesting Internship</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 14</b></p><p>Rarity’s Apartment, Manehatten </p><p>Braeburn was understandably upset when I explained what had happened in Equestria and the events that followed thereafter. Amongst my closest confidants, I couldn’t very well brush off the whole incident and claim to be perfectly fine. It exacted a toll on me mentally more so than physically. However, I would only discuss the matter with family if asked directly, rather than bring up the subject of my own volition. Braeburn and Coco were the exception, of course. </p><p>My parents would worry themselves to death if they knew that I’d willingly put myself in harm’s way, magic powers or not. Especially, when I stood up to those thugs clad in nothing except for my birthday suit. As for Sweetie, I’m not so sure. Given her penchant for graphic novels, sci-fi, and video games, she might be inclined to encourage my vigilante behavior and romanticize it to a certain degree. Neither appealed to me. Best to relegate such fantasies to the big screen.  </p><p>Like I’d told Braeburn, what happened between Doughnut Joe, the Magnolias, and I was a confluence of, shall we say, unique circumstances, unlikely to be repeated anytime soon. I was a jewelry maker, not some self-styled comic book heroine, intent on cleaning the streets of criminal scum. That was a job suited for the brave men and women of MPD. Even so, I shall openly admit that it felt good to save a man’s life. Since I was technically still out of the office until Monday, I had another three days to decompress, and relax from my ordeal.  </p><p>In case you’re wondering, the deadline to open up shop wasn’t set in stone. I’d decided to resume work on that day, given the fact that I was no longer in Equestria. Due to the time dilation between worlds, I’d only been gone for what amounted to four days in total. How odd. It seemed much longer on the other side. At some point, I’d have to ask Princess Twilight if she ever figured out the exact ratio. I suppose it truly was like Einstein had said: “<i>time is relative; it’s worth depends upon what we do as it is passing</i>”. Imagine that. Me, quoting a famous scientist!</p><p>I sighed to myself as I looked up at the ceiling from comfort of my own bed. The silk sheets felt marvelous against my bare skin, as always, but the experience would have been infinitely better with Braeburn by my side to cuddle. Had circumstances allowed, I would have made sweet, languid love to him all morning long, then ordered greasy hamburgers and fries in bed for lunch. Alas, it was not to be. Harvest time was near and his family needed him back in Ponyville. </p><p>Perhaps, sensing my loneliness, Extravagance hopped up onto the bed and nestled himself in the crook of my arm. I began massaging his scalp and he immediately began wagging his stubby tail back and forth. As a show of gratitude, he barked softly and began licking the side of my breast. The tickling sensation of his rough tongue against my nipple made me break out into a fit of giggles and helped to break me out of my funk somewhat. I scratched underneath his chin. </p><p>“I feel as though I should be doing something productive today instead of lazing about in bed.”</p><p>Extravagance looked up at me and whined. </p><p>“Is it really ok? I’m not the kind of woman who enjoys having idle hands. What if I—”</p><p>The bulldog whuffed loudly and placed his paw on my stomach. </p><p>“Oh, alright! I will refrain from working on anything for the time being. But I would like to check my email at the very least. Do I have your permission to retrieve my phone, darling?” </p><p>I reached over towards the nightstand and took hold of my smart phone. Obviously, it wasn’t a piece of technology that would have functioned in Equestria, so I left it at home. There wasn’t much in the way of texts or voicemail messages, as I had informed everyone about my absence prior to leaving. However, when I checked my email, there was a message sent by Sweetie at the top of the pile, so to speak. The subject title read: “Internship”. I tapped the screen and began to skim what she wrote. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#3C26AF">I’m sorry if this is kind of last minute, but mom said you’d be ok with me asking. The good news is that I managed to get a sponsored internship! You know, the one they set up for gifted young students. Anyway, I’m set to follow Countess Coloratura for two semesters. Isn’t that cool?!! Since her studio is in Manehatten, I figured that I could just stay with you for a while. I promise that I’ll pull my weight while I’m there. Please, sis! You’re the best. </span> </p><p>-<span style="color:#3C26AF">Sweetie</span> </p><p>What irritated me the most was typical behavior of my little sister. She neglected to inform me when she was supposed to arrive. I mean, sure, I had the guest room already set up and ready to go but I don’t want her showing up at some unholy hour of the night. Not only that, but I don’t think I had enough food in the pantry for the both of us. With a frustrated huff, I decided to worry about grocery shopping later. A hot shower was my first priority. I clambered out of bed, padded into the bathroom, and turned on the water jets. Extravagance followed along, as he was often wont to do. Far be it for me to criticize a dog who enjoys bathing with his mistress.  </p><p>Once we were nice and clean, I stepped out of the shower and began drying off. I had to wrap the towel around my hair instead of using a hairdryer, otherwise it would get frizzy if I dried it too quickly without using conditioner first. And no, I didn’t feel like going the extra mile today. Rest, relaxation, and reoperation were the name of the game. Just as I was about to pour myself a delicious cup of hazelnut crème coffee, the doorbell rang. Normally, I’d have the wherewithal to don a robe when answering the door, but I was so exhausted and used to being nude that I forgot.</p><p>When the door opened, my sister stood in the hallway with a sheepish smile. I ushered her inside and opened the fridge in order to retrieve some creamer for my coffee. While I was stirring, she set down her luggage, fidgeted in place, and waved to me. Unperturbed, I walked over to my recliner, sat down, and crossed one leg over the other in a ladylike fashion while I took a dainty sip from my mug. Still standing, Sweetie paused for a moment, unsure what to say or do. </p><p>I gestured her to sit on the couch. “Good morning, dearest sister.”</p><p>“Hey, Rarity! Did I—um—catch you at a bad time?” She asked nervously. </p><p>“Not really. I just got out of the shower, as you can see.” </p><p>Sweetie chuckled. “Yeah. Do you normally answer the door like that or…” </p><p>I shook my head slowly. “No, I do not. However, your arrival was unannounced and sudden. That combined with the level of exhaustion I’m experiencing, left me out of sorts. Now, would you be a dear and please explain why you neglected to ask my permission to stay here?” </p><p>Sweetie bit her lip. “Because I thought you’d be cool with it no matter what?” </p><p>“Be that as it may, there are preparations that need to be made in order to accommodate you.” </p><p>Sweetie looked down at her feet, rubbing them together as she did so. “Sorry. My bad.” </p><p>I took another swig of my coffee and sighed. “It’s not a big deal. We can go out grocery shopping later. The guest room is already made. Feel free to take off your clothes and get comfortable. Might I offer you some refreshments? Coffee, perhaps?”</p><p>Not wasting a second, Sweetie stripped, awkwardly flailing about to get her pink panties free from being wrapped around her leg, then carefully folded her clothes into a neat little pile once she was done. It hadn’t escaped my notice that she’d packed light for staying an entire two semesters. I suppose, she figured that she wouldn’t have to worry about what to wear while she stayed with me. Worst came to worst, we could always go out and buy her some more outfits. </p><p>I handed Sweetie a mug, which she accepted gratefully before taking a slurp. “So, I heard that you’re interning with the Countess. I’ve met her before at a social gathering here in Manehatten. A lovely woman by all accounts. How did you manage to catch her attention, if I may ask?” </p><p>My little sister perked up. “Everyone sent in audition clips. She must have liked mine the best, considering that I got the job—erm—internship, I mean. The best part is that I actually get paid to work with her! If you want, I can pay you rent. I know it’s a lot to ask, me staying here for so long. But my only other option is to ask mom and dad for hotel money or cancel it outright.”</p><p>Extravagance came waddling into the living room, clambered onto the couch, and sat atop my sister’s lap. Sweetie was more than happy to offer him affection, which he ate up voraciously. “Money is hardly an issue, darling. I’m more concerned about the lack of respect you have for my generosity, and by extension, my home. I know Father taught you better manners than that.” </p><p>Sweetie’s rosy blush colored not only her cheeks but spread all the way down towards the tips of her bountiful bosoms. It was a display I was all too familiar with, given that we both possessed similar, pale complexions. She clenched her toes while tears began to fill her eyes. “I’m sorry for being such a shitty little sister. You deserve so much better than that. I guess I got so excited about the whole thing that I forgot to take your feelings into account. I’m sorry, Rarity.” </p><p>I got out of the recliner, motioned for Sweetie to come over, and we shared a sisterly embrace. She immediately began crying as soon as her face touched my shoulder, but I expected as much. Sweetie was the type of girl who’d always worn her emotions on her sleeves, so to speak. After a minute or two of hair-stroking, back rubbing, and reassurances that I wasn’t upset, she finally calmed down a bit. I lamented the snot and drool that now coated my chest, but decided it wasn’t anything some soap and a washcloth couldn’t fix. Thus cleaned, I unwrapped my towel, and stretched out in front of the patio window. So be it if my neighbors got a peep show. </p><p>“Are you, like, one hundred percent sure you’re not upset?” Sweetie asked. </p><p>“Annoyed, perhaps, but I could never stay angry at my baby sister. I wasn’t planning on opening up shop until Monday, so we have the entire weekend to hang out together. We could go see a show, walk around Greenway Park, or just… laze about inside my apartment. Honestly, I hadn’t set any concrete plans before you arrived. The sky’s the limit, as they say!” </p><p>Sweetie ruffled Extravagance’s ears while he laid next to her on the couch. “Um… I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Wideway show before. I’d love to go but aren’t they expensive?” </p><p>I placed my hands on my hips and surveyed the city skyline. “They can be, depending on the show. Older ones such as <i>Poltergeist of the Playhouse</i>, are relatively affordable. Like I mentioned before, Sweetie, I am a woman of considerable means. You’re not going to break the piggy bank while staying here, I assure you. Would you like to see it this evening?” </p><p>Sweetie practically sprang off the couch like an Olympic gymnast and started jumping up and down excitedly. This caused her breasts to bounce around considerably but I declined to say anything, lest I put a hamper on her childish glee. “<b>THAT WOULD BE AWESOME</b>!!! Could we get dinner out too?! Oh! How about pizza? It’s supposed to be good in Manehatten, right?” </p><p>I chuckled. “Of course, darling. I know just the place.”</p><hr/><p>The weekend progressed far faster than I would have liked. But it’s as they say: time flies when you’re having fun! As adorable as it was to witness Sweetie’s childlike wonder watching the razzle dazzle of musical theater, we both had to get down to brass tacks once Monday arrived. Just like when we were still living together with our parents, my baby sister had a difficult time waking up in the morning. It made me giggle thinking of the numerous occasions where she almost walked out the door without a stitch of clothing on. Imagine the scandal! Oh ho~ </p><p>I, ever the early riser, already had a pot of coffee brewing and breakfast prepared. Well, prepared is probably a generous term. We’d bought some bagels from a local bakery yesterday morning, and I’d just toasted them and spread some cream cheese on top. Along with a small glass of orange juice, I microwaved some bacon as a side dish. While I was sitting at the table reviewing my schedule, Sweetie shuffled into the kitchen, yawned, and plopped into the seat across from me with the grace of an elephant seal. I smiled and invited her to join me for breakfast. </p><p>“Good morning, dear. Did you sleep well?” </p><p>Upon scratching her stomach, Sweetie smacked her lips. “Hrmm. Guess so.” </p><p>“Just remember to take a shower and comb your hair before we depart.”</p><p>Whilst nibbling on a strip of bacon, she looked out the window. “Not to sound rude, but what exactly is it that you do for a living, Rarity? I know you’re into jewelry design but Mom &amp; Dad don’t ever go into detail about it. Maybe you could give me a tour of your shop sometime?” </p><p>I ran my fingers through my hair. “No worries, darling. I don’t mind you asking. For the most part, I create pieces, display them in my shop, and people buy them. Lately, however, I’ve gotten an influx of commission requests from clients due to my appearance at the Charity Ball.”  </p><p>Sweetie’s eyes widened when she saw the picture of my ‘<i>costume</i>’ on screen. “Wow! I can’t believe you showed off that much skin in front of such a huge crowd! I know we’re nudists but that took a lot of guts. You look so beautiful! Did you do all the painting or someone else?” </p><p>I blushed at the compliment and cleared my throat. “A lady must be bold and properly represent her brand, after all. Thanks to the attention I garnered, a great deal of money was generated for charity that night. But to answer your question, a professional artist helped paint my body. Ironically, he was also the one who happened to buy the jewelry I was wearing too.” </p><p>“Anyone I would know?” Sweetie asked. </p><p>“Juan Pablo De Sombra. I had a lovely time working with him. He’s quite the consummate professional, if I do say so myself. I would gladly collaborate with him again.”</p><p>Sweetie nearly spat out her orange juice. “You got <b>THE SOMBRA</b> to paint your body?! </p><p>I showed my baby sister yet another picture, this time with me standing next to Sombra and his boyfriend at the ball. “I assure you that I am telling the truth.”</p><p>Sweetie’s mouth formed into an ‘<i>o</i>’ shape. “Holy cheese and crackers! Look at all those rich and famous people! I didn’t know you were so well connected with Manehatten’s upper crust. You know, I’m starting to think that maybe I didn’t earn my internship on merit alone…” </p><p>An icy knot of guilt formed in the pit of my stomach while I shuffled around uncomfortably in my seat. Yes, I’d met Countess Coloratura at the ball, but it wasn’t as though we were particularly close friends. More like associates, really. Oh, dear. I hope Coco didn’t whisper sweet nothings into her ear and convince—no, I mustn’t think like that! My little sister was a rising star; a talented musician in her own right. She’d earned her place at Coloratura’s studio. </p><p>I looked over at my sister and noticed that her expression had soured considerably from before. I closed my eyes, took in a deep breath to center myself, and placed my hand atop her own. She didn’t pull away from my gesture of affectionate support, but her eyes were downcast. Just when I thought we were getting along swimmingly, this happens! Such is the fate of sisters, I suppose. What could I possibly say in order to convince her that she was a beautiful, talented, young woman destined for greatness? The awkward silence between us was nigh unbearable. </p><p>“Listen, dear,” I encouraged, “I won’t deny that I’ve rubbed elbows with the rich and famous. However, that does not mean my presence at the Charity Ball was the sole reason you caught Countess Coloratura’s attention. For years, you’ve practiced and worked hard, improving your vocal acumen. That is yours, and yours alone, to claim. I suppose what I’m trying to say is don’t sell yourself short. Take pride in what you have accomplished in your young life, thus far.”</p><p>Sweetie let out a watery chuckle, sniffling as she did so. “Sorry if I’m getting all emotional again, Rarity. You’ve gotta understand that I’m a total nervous wreck right now! I’m under a ton of pressure to make a good first impression with her. What if I mess up?”</p><p>“Then you pick yourself back up, apologize, and try again. Coloratura is as human as you or I. She makes plenty of mistakes herself, I’m sure. My advice might seem rather cliché, but you have to keep your chin up and put your best foot forward. Is there anything I might offer to help calm your nerves? Quite frankly, I’d suggest a stiff martini but that wouldn’t be appropriate.” </p><p>Sweetie laughed. “No, nothing like that! Seriously though, your advice is helpful. And—uh—all the emotional support too. I wouldn’t be able to do this without you, Rarity.” </p><p>“I should think not! Otherwise, you wouldn’t have a place to live in Manehatten.” I joked.  </p><p>Sweetie rolled her eyes. “Yeah, yeah. I know. For the record, you don’t have to drive me there every day. I can just take the subway. It’s not as though her studio is super far away from here.”</p><p>“I am aware. However, I wanted to be there with you on your first day.”</p><p>Sweetie cocked her brow as she finished what remained of her breakfast. “<b>OH NO</b>! Don’t you dare pull a dad on me! He tried to do that freshman year and it was sooooo embarrassing. Took me forever to live down the shame. In fact, I still get teased for it to this very day! Look, I get that you’re trying to be a supportive big sister and all… but I have to do this on my own.”</p><p>I waved my hand and scoffed. “I would never do something so gauche, darling. Allow me to clarify. The Countess wanted to discuss an upcoming show with me. Or more precisely, a piece of jewelry that she would like to have commissioned for it. We just so happen to be going to the same place and meeting the same person today. That is all~” </p><p>“Oh. Talk about a coincidence.” </p><p>“Indeed,” I admitted, “I am quite looking forward to working on a project again. All this idling around simply isn’t my style. Feel free to use the shower, I already bathed earlier.”</p><p>While Sweetie made her way towards the bathroom, I decided to get dressed in the meantime. I don’t imagine Rara would mind if showed up in something casual, but looking one’s best in a professional setting is a must. A nice, white ruffled blouse to match my complexion, a black mini skirt, and cherry red heels to finish off the fabulous up-and-coming businesswoman look! </p><p>I wasn’t terribly fond of donning cosmetics or undergarments for that matter, but both would be necessary in this case. Even a minor application of violet eye shadow and matching lipstick went a long way. As for panties and a bra, I fished around in my drawer until I found a comfortable set. Nothing scandalous, I assure you. Just your average cotton piece that came in packs of six. A lot of woman went out of their way to buy flashier, sexier variants. I didn’t bother, being a nudist. As the saying goes: “<i>If one doesn’t wear panties, they can never get into a bunch</i>”. </p><p>Just as I finished getting dressed, sans my heels, Extravagance waddled into the room. Ever the drama king, he whined loudly and gazed up at me with his sad, puppy-dog eyes. Over the years, he must have made the connection between me wearing clothes and going out. What a clever little doggie he was! I knelt down and ruffled the fur atop his head, assuring him I would return. </p><p>“Oh, stop being so dramatic! You have plenty to eat and drink. We’ll return before you know it.” </p><p>Knowing full-well that his cries for attention had no effect on me, he scampered towards the guest room where Sweetie was busy combing her luscious curls. She’d gotten dressed as well, albeit her outfit was decidedly more conservative than my own. A simple, yellow dress with a pink cardigan draped over top, accompanied by a pair of white sneakers. Extravagance nudged the back of her ankle with his snout, whuffing loudly to get her attention. </p><p>Sweetie petted his head. “I’m sorry, buddy. But I can’t play with you right now.” </p><p>The bulldog whined pathetically, his ears drooping as he sat on his haunches. </p><p>“Don’t mind, Extravagance. He’s just upset that we aren’t going to be around all day to spoil him rotten. I suppose I’m to blame. I dare say, he’s the most pampered bulldog in the entire city.” </p><p>Sweetie giggled. “That’s for sure! So—um—how does my outfit look?” </p><p>“It should suffice. Conservative is definitely the way to go, darling.” </p><p>Sweetie took in a deep breath and blew it out slowly, presumably to calm herself. “How’s my hair? Sometimes it can be a real pain in the butt to make presentable and—”</p><p>I grasped her hand and ushered her along. “Everything is fine! We mustn’t dawdle. Traffic at this hour of the morning can be—ah—challenging if one doesn’t take the proper time to account for it. I have some chewing gum in my purse if you want to freshen your breath. Let’s go!” </p><hr/><p>Even with the inclusion of downtown traffic, we managed to make it to Countess Coloratura’s studio on time. It was one of those buildings that looked far more impressive on the inside than would appear at first glance. The same could be said of many places in Manehatten. After the security guard confirmed that we were expected, he escorted us to the main office where Rara herself was busy attending to something on her laptop. Normally, such mundane tasks would befall to a manager, rather than the entertainer. Maybe he was out sick today. </p><p>I’d half expected that we’d chat with an assistant for a while rather than talk to the star of the show. Then again, I was basing my assumption on what I knew of the entertainment industry. Perhaps, she preferred the personal approach when it came to her employees and or guests? Whatever the reason, I was grateful to be able to speak with her in person, face to face, considering that she was the one who would be wearing the piece I was going to craft. </p><p>Similar to how I’d seen her at that Charity Ball, she was not clad in her performance regalia. Rather than a silk dress, this time she wore a simple black blouse that cut off around the shoulders, a gold half note necklace, blue jeans, and sneakers. Very casual. Her navy-blue hair was styled in a plain braid along the side with a teal scrunchie that matched her highlights. Sweetie seemed surprised to see her in such a mundane state, considering that she looked so exotic and extravagant while performing on stage. But that was all part of that act.  </p><p>I gave Coloratura the customary hug and kiss to the cheek. Once that was finished, Sweetie and I took a seat across from her. “Good morning, darling! How are you doing today?” </p><p>“About as well as can be expected, given the circumstances.” Coloratura answered in a tired voice. </p><p>“What’s wrong? You sound utterly exhausted. No, offence, of course.” I quickly added. </p><p>“None taken. I probably look like something the cat dragged in too. Heh. Let’s just say that I had to let Sven Gallop go because of a disagreement we had regarding marketing deals. It’s only been a week, so I’m still interviewing new candidates for his position. In the meantime, I’ve had to take over some of his duties while trying to prepare for a show. It’s pretty rough…” </p><p>I nodded in sympathy. “I can only imagine. Oh! Where are my manners? Sitting next to me is my little sister, Sweetie Belle. She’s going to be your new intern for the foreseeable future.” </p><p>Under normal circumstances, I would have let her introduce herself. However, given how nervous she looked, I figured it was better if I broke the ice first. After all, Rara and I had already met once before. Coloratura stood up and offered her hand. “Hello, Sweetie! It’s a pleasure to meet such a young talent. Glad to have you aboard! Sorry, this isn’t the glamourous introduction you might have imagined, but this is the business side of the industry.”</p><p>Sweetie’s voice squeaked slightly when she answered. “Likewise, Miss Coloratura.”</p><p>The songstress laughed. “No need to be so formal. Just call me Rara. Would you like something to eat or drink? I think there might be some doughnut holes and apple juice leftover.”</p><p>“N-no thank you. We already ate before driving to the studio.” </p><p>Coloratura shrugged. “Well, ok. Feel free to partake if the mood strikes. When I listened to your audition tape, I have to say that I was very impressed with your vocal range. Not only that but your grades are top notch! There’s no doubt in my mind that you deserve to be here.” </p><p>Sweetie blushed like a tomato at the praise and squirmed in her seat. “Thank you, ma’am.”</p><p>“That being said, I have to warn you. While I would like to focus on improving your vocals, being in the music industry is more than just having raw talent. It’s about discipline, proper communication, and hard work. That’s why I’d like to teach you about the managerial side of the business too. I think you’re plenty smart enough for that part!”  </p><p>Sweetie pointed towards the laptop. “Is that what you’re doing right now?” </p><p>“You could say that but more like cleaning up a mess.”</p><p>Once again, I could tell that Rara was trying her best not to seem irritated for Sweetie’s sake.  Whatever had transpired between her and Sven Gallop must have been incredibly stressful. Not to mention the extra work load she had to handle with his absence. Luckily, there was a certain dress maker who would ensure that she was well taken care of. And speak of the devil, so shall he appear! Or her, in this case. Coco shuffled into the office with a coffee caddie in hand. She placed it onto the table, leaned over, and kissed Coloratura on the lips. It was a chaste display of affection if I ever saw one, but spoke volumes about how much they cared for one another.  </p><p>Once Coloratura began taking a sip from her cup, Coco began rubbing her shoulders. “Are you still revising those proposals? You’ve been at it for hours! Take a break. You need rest.” </p><p>Rara sighed. “I wish I could, Coco. But you know how contract negotiations are.”</p><p>“That’s what lawyers are for. Let them do their job. Can you at least look at the concept drawing I made for you next show? Might as well show it Rarity while you’re at it since she’s here.”</p><p>They invited me to come take a look, so I did. Coco’s attention to detail and drawing were beautiful as always. However, I couldn’t help but notice how risqué the outfit was. I was under the impression that Coloratura was going for “<i>Arabian Princess</i>” chique, given the near-translucent, flowing silk motif and the generous amount of skin it would reveal. Not only that but the design called for a what amounted to bejeweled version of pasties. They weren’t impossible to create from a metallurgical perspective, rather prohibitively expensive for most clients. </p><p>I coughed, feeling somewhat uneasy. “Are you certain this is an appropriate outfit for the show?” </p><p>Rara cheeks flushed and she looked over at her girlfriend with an affectionate smile. “I was inspired by what you wore at the Charity Ball. I figured that if you could show that much confidence in your own skin, then so could I. For years, I’ve relied on hair dye, copious amounts of makeup, and wild outfits. This time, I’m going for a look that’s closer to the natural me.”</p><p>“I’m flattered by your compliment, darling. Truly, I am. But are you absolutely certain that you wish to proceed with the jewelry design? I only say this because what you’re asking for will just barely cover up your—erm—unmentionables. You’ll most certainly need to wear an adhesive underneath them in order to ensure that you don’t fall victim to a wardrobe malfunction.” </p><p>The singer nodded emphatically. “I’m sure. To be quite frank, it’s been a long time since I’ve felt sexy and free on stage. Not only do I owe it to myself, but my fans too. Besides, it’ll give Coco something nice to watch while I sing and dance. Isn’t that right, my dear?”</p><p>In response to the comment, Coco buried her face behind her sketchbook. “<b>RARA</b>! You shouldn’t discuss what we like to do in private. Especially, in the workplace! Ooooh, if I didn’t love you so much, I’d—well, I don’t know what I’d do, but consider yourself put on notice.” </p><p>I couldn’t help but laugh. Coco was just so adorable when she got flustered. “Alright then. I’ll make sure to use rubies and gold to match the red silk Coco suggested. One piece of advice that I shall pass on is make sure that you don’t bend over too far. Lest you wish to give everyone an intimate look at your backdoor, as it were. Oh, and make sure to wax as well!” </p><p>“Duly noted. If you don’t mind, could you please submit the outfit plans for approval? Thanks, dear! With that business concluded, we can finally discuss your commission price, Rarity.”  </p><p>While the dress designer organized her sketchbook, she glanced over at Sweetie. “My goodness! I’m sorry for not noticing you earlier, Sweetie. I didn’t know you apprenticed under your sister.” </p><p>Sweetie shook her head. “I’m not. My internship is here, at the studio.” </p><p>“Oh. Well, congratulations! It’s nice to finally meet you in person.” </p><p>The two of them exchanged a brief hug, then Coco scampered off to submit the paperwork. I leaned back in my chair and let out a loud yawn. “Pardon me, darling. My morning coffee must be wearing off already. If you’d like, you can just send me an email copy of the drawing. Hmm. As far as price goes, if you want it in solid gold, the price will be significantly more than plated.”</p><p>“Not surprised there. I assure you, Rarity. Price is not an issue.” Rara answered. </p><p>I clapped my hands together. “Very well. I’m afraid that I can’t give you an exact quote until I’ve had a chance to sit down in my workshop and measure out the materials needed. However, I can provide a ballpark estimate. Since this will be a three-piece set, I’ll give you a bundle price. I believe two million should just about cover it. Does that sound fair to you?” </p><p>Sweetie looked as though her eyes were about to bulge out of their sockets. Well accustomed to dealing with such high amounts of money, Rara barely batted an eyelash at my estimate. To be quite honest, I think she believed that I was going to charge her at least twice that amount. With a firm handshake, we reached a verbal agreement. I bade my little sister goodbye, wished her luck on her first day, and headed to the shop. Finally! A new project to drive my creative engine. </p><hr/><p>Molecular Gastro-Pub “<i>Proton</i>”, Downtown Manehatten </p><p>Monday nights were not exactly prime time to go bar hopping. Especially, at upscale, trendy places like <i>Proton</i> that catered to more affluent clientele. Yet, this is where Sven Gallop, former manager of Countess Coloratura, chose to drown his sorrows and while away the hours. He sipped on his artisan avocado foam martini with a sour expression.  </p><p>Not even the dehydrated, gluten-free salted peanut puffs were enough to make him forget what had transpired a week prior. Upon finishing his overpriced cocktail, he ordered another. The bartender knew it was already his third round, but declined to admonish a paying customer. With a sigh, Sven watched the latest news report on the television positioned above the bar.  </p><p>A stout little man with a white mowhawk, grey skin, and dressed in military fatigues hopped up onto the barstool next to Sven and ordered a beer. He began stuffing a handful of peanut puffs into his mouth like a squirrel, earning him a few dirty looks and further alienating him from the rest of the patrons. Unfortunately for Sven, he had no other choice but to put up with the uncouth man’s behavior. It was the price one paid for dealing with hired muscle, or guns, in this case. </p><p>“Swanky place ya picked, boss. Not my usual watering hole but hey! You’re paying the tab!” </p><p>“If you don’t mind, Mr. Grubber, I’d let to discuss our arrangement.” Sven intoned. </p><p>“A straight shooter. No, problem! I can respect a man who gets down ta business. But—erm—wouldn’t ya like ta sober up a bit first? I can’t imagine that’s your first drink. I’m not judging, by the way. There’s plenty of functional alcoholics out there. Trust me! I know a few.”</p><p>Sven closed his eyes and groaned. “I am <b>NOT</b> nearly drunk enough for this conversation, Mr. Grubber. In any case, I am ready to discuss the plan now, if you please. Proceed.”</p><p>“Sure thing. So—um—you want this to be a standard kidnapping and ransom, right? I know a few PMCs who’d be willing to go along with the plan but are you sure this is what you wanna do? I mean, it is like… <b>SUPER</b> illegal and you could go to jail for a while.”</p><p>Sven pounded his fist against the bar. “Yes! Just like we discussed in the email. As far as I’m concerned, that glittery bitch owes me for everything I did for her! Without me, she would never have become the star she is today. Those marketing deals were perfectly legitimate!”</p><p>Grubber took a sip of his beer and frowned. “If you say so, boss. Just so we’re clear, do you want me and the boys to rough her up a bit? In my experience, a little pain goes a long way to making people do what you want. Obviously, we won’t do anything too extreme. We’re mercs not butchers. So… cuts and bruises are ok with you then?”</p><p>“Whatever you believe is necessary, Mr. Grubber.”</p><p>The mercenary chuckled nervously. “Cool. Looking forward to working with ya, Mr. Gallop.”</p>
