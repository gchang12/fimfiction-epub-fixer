		<h1>A Bold Proposal For Charity</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 3</b></p><p>Orange Manor, Manehatten </p><p>With my design proposal finally completed just yesterday evening, I emailed Dalia with all the details and awaited her response. She was quick to get back to me. From what I could tell, she was very pleased with my proposal and wanted me to meet with her at Orange Manor to iron out a few things before the piece was crafted. After getting dressed in a simple business jacket, skirt, and heels, I took a cab and waited patiently at the entrance for their invitation. </p><p>Being that it was Saturday, I didn’t have to worry about closing the shop early. The number of customers I’d gotten this week had been steady, but not anywhere near what I would consider overwhelming. In the back of my mind, I knew that the Charity Gala would drastically increase the foot traffic at my shop, <b>IF</b> I played my cards right. That’s why I’d poured so much time, energy, and effort into making the show piece a memorable one. My brand was on the line! </p><p>One of the service staff greeted me politely and asked me to follow him. Seeing as how I’d only visited the estate once, I acquiesced and once again marveled at all the wonders Orange Manor had to offer. A few minutes later, we arrived at a set of doors that led to an indoor pool. While not quite as large as an Olympic-sized one, it was roomy enough to swim in laps if one was so inclined. The décor was clearly designed to give off an Ancient Roaman vibe. Doric columns, nude statues of various athletes in heroic poses, frescos, ect. Tasteful without being tacky. </p><p>The staff member gestured towards the shallow end where I caught a glimpse of Dalia. She was about neck deep in the water, and enjoying a cup of coffee while she relaxed. Just as I was about to ask where we were meeting, the staff member was already gone. As I drew closer, I noticed little vapors of steam rising off the surface of the water, indicating that it was heated. </p><p>Given the general humidity within the room, this didn’t surprise me. However, what did surprise me was Dalia herself. When she rose up out of the water to greet me, it immediately became apparent that she was wearing nothing more than a polite smile. I wasn’t embarrassed, per say. A woman has the right to dress (<i>or not in this case</i>) as she pleases in her own abode. Rather, I was a bit taken back. Unsure of what else to do, I waved and greeted her with a smile of my own.   </p><p>“Good Afternoon, Rarity. I hope you don’t mind the <i>casual attire</i> for today’s meeting. I’ve never once bothered to wear a swimsuit when I go for a dip, so why start now? Ha! I can tell you for a fact that my husband certainly doesn’t mind. Come on in! The water’s just the right temperature. We can chat once you’ve gotten the chance to get situated.” </p><p>When in Roam, I suppose. I disrobed quickly and placed my clothing atop the counter over by the doors. Upon entering the water, I let out a contented sigh. It was indeed heated! Not quite as warm as a hot tub, but it felt extraordinarily pleasant nonetheless. I waded over to Dalia and sat next to her. She stretched out her arms with a loud groan, and took another sip of her coffee. </p><p>“Isn’t this a whole lot more relaxed than sitting around in some stuffy office?” </p><p>I nodded. “I would imagine so. Mrs. Orange, what would you like to discuss—”</p><p>“Please. I must insist that you call me Dalia, dear. There’s no need to rush. It’s Saturday, after all. Take some time to decompress from the work week. Would you like something to drink?”</p><p>“Erm—yes, please. Tea would be lovely.” </p><p>Dalia lifted her foot out of the water and wiggled her toes. “To be honest, Ms. Rarity, I already knew quite a lot about you before we met at the luncheon to discuss terms.” </p><p>“What? Did Braeburn say—”</p><p>Dalia giggled. “No, my nephew had nothing to do with it. As you already know, my dearest niece, Apple Bloom, is close friends with your little sister. They’ve come to play here at Orange Manor on occasion. That’s how I became acquainted with both Sweetie and Cookie Crumbles. Pardon me, I meant to say your mother. We became fast friends too.” </p><p>I rubbed my hands together underneath the water. “I take it that you know about our lifestyle?” </p><p>“Mhmm. I’m aware that your family are nudists.” </p><p>How very typical of my mother and sister. It’s just like them to—my apologies, I suppose I should elaborate on the point that I’m trying to make. You see, my family has always been far more forthright when discussing our lifestyle with others than me. Father, in particular, believes that any friends worth their salt should accept us for who we are entirely, or not at all. </p><p>Suffice to say: I had a rather unpleasant experience in grade school regarding the matter. About a year and a half after Sweetie was born, I’d invited one of my closest friends (<i>and neighbor</i>) to the house for a playdate. At the time, we were still living in a suburb of Whinnyapolis and the neighborhood was a fairly tight-knit community. Me being the naïve seven-and-a-half-year-old that I was, believed that my “<i>friend</i>” wouldn’t have any issues meeting my family. </p><p>Unfortunately, I could not have been more wrong. Daffodil simply was not prepared to accept the fact that we didn’t normally wear clothing around the house. My father had been sitting on the couch, watching football as he is often wont to do, and my mother was busy breast-feeding Sweetie in the kitchen. All in plain sight of my “<i>friend</i>”. Daffodil promptly freaked out and ran back to her house before I had a chance to explain that nudity was the norm for us.  </p><p>The situation only got worse from there. Daffodil proceeded to tell her parents all about the “<i>weird nakey people</i>” living two houses down. My father had a rather heated telephone call with Daffodil’s father trying to get him to understand our way of life. It only partially succeeded. When I went to school the next day, salacious rumors had already begun to spread about me. Everywhere I went, the other children would bully and tease me for being different.  </p><p>My father finally drew a line in the sand when I came home one day in tears, wearing a completely ruined dress. It was at that moment, he decided that Whinnyapolis wasn’t the best place for us to live. So, we wound up moving to Ponyville where I was promptly enrolled in a different school. A fresh start, as it were. From that point forward, I did my best to keep my identity as a naturist from others. I couldn’t risk being bullied and ostracized by the very people whom I thought were my friends again. That’s why I’ve been so reluctant to share it until now. </p><p>I cringed slightly. “Ah… that term is a bit gauche, Dalia. We prefer to be called naturists.” </p><p>“My apologies, Ms. Rarity. I wasn’t aware there was a distinction between the two. I’ll try to be more sensitive about it from now on. I… hope that I haven’t offended you.” </p><p>I waved my hands. “Oh! Of course, not! I’m just happy that you’re trying to understand our lifestyle in the first place. And I—ehm—also appreciate the gesture you’ve made today.” </p><p>Dalia laughed melodically. “Not a problem at all~ To be honest, I’d much rather conduct business matters in my birthday suit than a pantsuit any day of the week. Nothing is as comfortable or fits a woman better than her own skin, eh?”</p><p>“Certainly not.” I agreed. </p><p>Dalia suddenly dove underwater. When she surfaced once more, she began floating on her back. “I can see why being a naturist would appeal to some people. It feels very freeing not to have to worry about wearing a swimsuit in the pool. I don’t imagine I’d ever go to a nude beach or anything like that, but I do enjoy skinning dipping from time to time.”</p><p>“As I do. It’s even better when you’re outdoors. Nothing quite can compare to it.” </p><p>Dalia swam over to the edge of the pool and took a swig of her coffee. “Seeing as how it’s getting close to lunch time, how about we just eat in here? And before you ask, no I don’t plan on getting dressed. It’s my manor; I can damn-well wear whatever I please. Even if it happens to be nothing at all! What would you like, dear? My chef can cook just about anything.” </p><p>My stomach rumbled in response. I blushed accordingly. “Well, I—erm—I’m not quite sure what I’m in the mood for. You said just about anything, right? What about a big, greasy bacon cheeseburger? Goodness, I haven’t had one of those in ages! And if it’s not too much trouble… could we get a plate of curly fries too?” </p><p>“Consider it done, Miss Rarity.”</p><p>A nonplused butler came strolling into the pool room about twenty minutes later with the requested dish. Ever the professional, he set the platter by the edge of the pool and gave us a polite bow when Dalia thanked him. I decided to get out of the water, dry myself off, and head over to one of the tables situated near the far side of the room. Dalia joined me shortly thereafter. </p><p>One of the best parts about dining in the nude is that you don’t have to worry about staining your clothes. Given how messy cheeseburgers are, this most certainly counted as a blessing. I nearly choked on a french-fry when a piece of bacon landed on Dalia’s breast. She promptly plucked the meaty morsel off of herself and tossed into her mouth without hesitation. I ended up getting a glob of cheese on my thigh shortly thereafter. We both shared at laugh at how proper ladies like ourselves were eating like a couple (<i>including the naked part</i>) of pigs. Neither of us cared at all! </p><p>Dalia leaned back in her chair and let out a contented sigh. “I took a look at your design for the necklace, Miss Rarity. And I must say, it’s quite stunning. What was your inspiration?” </p><p>“I was watching a documentary about the ancient Aztecs and I had an epiphany. In a bold move, I decided to recreate the mysterious splendor of their lost civilization! I like to call it <i>Native-chic</i>. What do you think, darling? Does that sound catchy enough for Manehatten’s elite?” </p><p>Dalia nodded in agreement. “Most likely. They’re all suckers for anything retro. You know, I have a feeling that many people will be visiting your shop after the Charity Gala concludes. If you wanted to make an even bolder statement, you should show up in Aztec dress too!” </p><p>Even though she’d meant it as a joke, I seriously considered what it would mean to do such a thing. Seeing as how the Aztecs wore very little clothing, and I detested cumbersome cocktail dresses, it was a marriage of what one might call: “<i>The best of both worlds</i>”. The wheels of my mind turned for a few moments. A rather risqué idea came to me as I glanced down at my feet. What if I became part of the showpiece itself by way of embodying the art? </p><p>“You might just be onto something, Dalia.” </p><p>Dalia cocked her brow in confusion. “Whatever do you mean, dear?” </p><p>“What if I modeled the necklace myself but incorporated it into a work of living art? By that, I mean body paint. I’ve seen pictures of it done before and it’s quite remarkable!”</p><p>Dalia rubbed her chin in thought. “Well, it would certainly turn heads at the Gala. I have to warn you though, Miss Rarity. If this isn’t done with the utmost care and professionalism, you could cause a massive scandal. Some people might even denounce you for it. But, at the end of the day, it’s your body, your necklace, and ultimately, your decision.”</p><p>“I’m not terribly concerned about myself, Dalia. But I appreciate your concern for my wellbeing. I have no issue letting others see my body. I’m also proud of who I am and how I look. What does concern me, however, is ensuring that we raise as much money as possible for those in need. To that end, a proper lady must be willing to make sacrifices for the greater good.”  </p><p>Dalia stood up and clapped her hands together. “Alright, then. If this is the path you wish to take, I shall help you as much as I can. Fortunately, I know some of the best make-up artists in Manehatten. I’m sure we’ll be able to work something out. I’ll let you know when I find one.” </p><p>I have her a big hug. “Thank you, darling. It means a great deal to me.” </p><p>“You’re quite welcome. This will be one hell of a Gala. Ha!” </p><hr/><p>When I got back to the shop, I immediately began work on Dalia’s commission. The major base components of the set (<i>I would be wearing more than just the necklace</i>) were comprised mostly of gold and turquoise. Luckily, I had plenty of both in my storeroom. With a pulse of magic, I called out to them, and bade the minerals to heed my command. Ehehe. Right. I really ought to explain the magic bit, shouldn’t I? Lest everyone think I’m some lost pony princess. </p><p>The birth of my powers, as it were, began when my friends and I stayed at Camp Everfree. The forest had been kind enough to provide us with crystals infused with magic that eventually transformed into geodes we could wear around our necks. Each of us were granted different abilities: super speed, mind reading, telekinesis ect. I received the power to manipulate minerals with my will. That included: moving them, melting them, shaping them. You get the idea. </p><p>Call it fate or whatever you’d like, but these abilities had helped me immensely with my craft. I still went to college and got the proper background for understanding them. Someone randomly opening a shop with no prior training and fabulous jewelry was bound to raise questions. Just to err on the side of precaution, I was fully trained and certified on how to craft jewelry the old-fashioned way too. I will admit that sometimes, I prefer to make pieces that way. </p><p>Even though the molten gold obeyed my every command, I made sure to wear plenty of protective gear to ward against burns and whatnot. I directed it towards the custom mold sitting on my crafting bench and poured the appropriate amount into each section. I could cool it quickly with my powers, but I found that letting it do so naturally was best. In the meantime, I surveyed the raw chunks of turquoise and began shaping them into smooth ovals. </p><p>After two hours, I was satisfied with how the necklace had set. It was shaped similarly to a crescent moon, and designed to cover both the neck and parts of the collar bone. Each segment was rectangular was stylized with motifs of Aztec animals and interlocked with the next portion for stability. The only part that was different was the segment in the very center. Instead of being rectangular, it was shaped like the head of a high priest. </p><p>I began fusing the turquoise to each segment, roughly in the center. Once they were set, I levitated a small ingot of silver, melted it, and used that as a contrast to make the motifs stand out against the gold background. The final touch was a pair of polished moonstones. I carefully placed them within the eye sockets of the high priest. When I stood back and surveyed my work, I let out a satisfied grunt after wiping the sweat from my brow. </p><p>To quote a certain archeologist: “<i>It appeared as though it belonged in a museum</i>”. That wasn’t the exact quote, as Rainbow Dash would have immediately corrected me on my cinematic <i>faux pas</i>. I was paraphrasing, of course. Well, whatever. We can’t all be perfect when it comes to memorizing lines from a movie. In any case, I was quite pleased with how the piece turned out. </p><p>I repeated the process for a pair of gold bracers. Same motifs, same gems. I also created a pair of gold hoop earrings, and a clasp to keep my hair fastened in place. With the later, I decided to add an amethyst in the center to accentuate my natural hair color. Not bad for five hours’ worth of work, if I do say so myself. </p><p>I glanced over at my phone and realized that I really ought to get some dinner in my belly and clean up too. Even though I was covered in soot and sweat, I threw on an old t-shirt &amp; running shorts (<i>my go to outfit for post jewelry smithing</i>) and jogged back to my apartment. Thankfully, it wasn’t very far away. A block or so, to be precise. I’d always been grateful for the short commute. Some people had it much worse than me. </p><p>One luxurious shower later, I was yet again nude and squeaky clean. As a happy Rarity should be! The first thing I did was send the photos I’d taken of the jewelry to Dalia. Mere moments later, she responded and was thoroughly impressed by the designs. I sighed in relief. It was one thing to show a client a concept drawing and quite another to present the finished product. </p><p>Extravagance came pattering out into the kitchen while I was scrambling up some eggs, diced vegetables, and hash browns. He nuzzled his moist snout right up against my ankle and I patted his head in return. I know it wasn’t the healthiest meal choice, considering that I’d had a bacon cheeseburger for lunch but I didn’t feel like cooking anything more complicated. I was quite exhausted and simply wanted to get dinner over with. I made more than enough for the both of us (<i>yes, I know he’s a spoiled pooch</i>) and took my plate out into the living room so that I could relax and watch a little tv while I ate on the couch. </p><p>I ran my fingers along Trav’s coat. “What do you think, darling? Am I making the right choice?” </p><p>Trav looked up at me inquisitively. He probably wanted me to elaborate.</p><p>“It’s just that I don’t want to draw the wrong kind of attention to myself. I suppose all I can do now is trust that Dalia has some top-notch artists to help make me look fabulous. And—um—I’d also like to see Braeburn’s reaction. I imagine he won’t be able to take his eyes off of me.” </p><p>Trav whuffed in response. </p><p>“What? A lady is allowed her fantasies. Yes, I realize that I shall be wearing little more than a few layers of paint in front of a large crowd of Manehatten’s elite. But showing some skin here and there—ah—well, pretty much everywhere, has never bothered me before and it certainly won’t now. I’ll be nervous, of course. But that’s to be expected.” </p><p>Trav smacked his chops and snuggled up against my thigh.  </p><p>“Hmm. You probably don’t care either way, do you? Alright, then. It shall do me no good to obsess over the whole thing. Let’s just eat, relax, and watch a documentary about penguins.” </p><hr/><p>At Dalia’s behest, I awoke early the next morning and dressed in nothing more than a silk robe and flip flops. She insisted that I come over to Orange Manor to have the body painting done so that I wouldn’t have to deal with the awkwardness of traveling there myself by cab. The Charity Gala was due to start at eight o’clock that evening but since it would take several hours to apply the paint, I would need to begin the process post haste. </p><p>One ride in a luxurious Orange Family car later, I arrived at the entrance and was greeted by Dalia. We exchanged a brief, but warm embrace and set about getting my body painted for the evening’s festivities. I’d gotten the impression that the Oranges were patrons of the arts, so it didn’t surprise me in the least that they had an art studio. Inside, the floor had been covered by a white tarp, a tall mirror had been set up, and there was a chair nearby for me to sit in. </p><p>The expert in question stood a few paces away, looking outside the window. He was tall, muscular, and had skin as dark as coal. The tight, tan-colored chinos and pink polo shirt he wore did little to disguise the fact that he was in fantastic shape. I found myself blushing at the thought of removing my robe in front of him. He was quite an attractive man, after all. When I announced my presence, he finally turned around, his long ebony locks swaying behind him. </p><p>“<i>Buenos días</i>, Miss Belle. It is a pleasure to meet your acquaintance.” </p><p>Much to my embarrassment, I laughed and snorted at the same time. Way to be a proper lady, Rarity. “Hello there! I’m going to be your model today.” </p><p>“<i>Si</i>. Mrs. Orange informed me of this. My name is Juan Pablo De Sombra, but you can just call me Sombra for short. I shall be painting your body today. Please undress at your leisure. I would like to see what I’m working with today.” </p><p>I slipped out of my robe and kicked off my flip flops in an instant. There really wasn’t any point in being bashful about it. I would be functionally nude for the foreseeable future. Mr. Sombra studied my body with the practiced eye of an artist, appraising each and every one of my features. After jotting something down on his notepad, he clapped his hands together. </p><p>“I must say, Miss Rarity. You have a magnificent figure. It is no mystery to me why you would want to show the world your natural beauty. Such a fine body as this would be spoiled by a mere dress. That is why I shall transform you into a living canvas. Is this what you desire?”</p><p>I nodded enthusiastically. “Yes, sir! Did Mrs. Orange happen to clue you in on the details?” </p><p>“She mentioned something about making you look like an Aztec priestess? If so, this is a grand idea. I am confident that you will make my people proud by embodying our culture.”  </p><p>“My goodness! I hadn’t realized that your ancestors were Aztec. How splendid!”</p><p>Sombra knelt down and fixed his gaze in-between my legs. I very nearly cupped my hands over my privates at the sudden invasion of my personal space. “Hmm. While your <i>vello púbico</i> is lovely and well-groomed, I’m afraid that it must be removed. It will interfere with the painting process, otherwise. My sincere apologies, Miss Rarity. I hope you understand.” </p><p>“Removed? But I didn’t bring anything to—”</p><p>Sombra waved his hand. “Not to worry. I am quite skilled at Brazilian waxes. If you would just take a seat on the chair, I’ll have your <i>coño</i> nice and smooth in no time at all.”</p><p>I suppose that I should have expected this. I really didn’t want to remove all of my pubic hair but Sombra had a point. It would only get in the way if I kept it. While I spread my legs apart to give him easier access, I was impressed at the speed and gentleness with which he waxed me. In a matter of minutes, I was as bare as a baby’s bottom. A slight shiver went down my spine. It was a little bit draftier in the room now that I didn’t have anything covering my womanhood. </p><p>I chuckled awkwardly while he cleaned his hands in the sink. “Well, that certainly feels… different. I appreciate that you made it as painless as possible.” </p><p>“I could tell that keeping it intact was important to you. But know that your sacrifice will be worth it in the end. Think of how many people will marvel at your body when we are finished.” </p><p>Before Sombra got started in earnest, we discussed what sort of color scheme I wanted. He suggested red ochre as the base with jade lines to contrast with the gold jewelry. In my mind’s eye, I tried to get a good picture of it but I’d never seen enough Aztec priestesses to make a judgement call. In the end, I decided to trust his artistic opinion and go with the flow.  </p><p>What transpired over the next few hours was both exhilarating and dreadfully boring at the same time. I was glad that the weather was warm because the paint wasn’t at all when Sombra applied it to my skin. Just as we’d agreed, he applied a few layers of red ochre to my entire body and horizontal lines of jade that started at my feet and went all the way up to my eyes. </p><p>Sombra applied several layers of silicone-based paint over the entire length my vulva and nipples. He explained that this was to ensure that they were properly obscured, otherwise they would be very easy to spot by the public. Those particular areas were fashioned to resemble strategically placed gold symbols. The piece covering my vulva was removable via a thin plug, so that I could use the restroom if the need arose. I thought that was very clever of Sombra. </p><p>I took it upon myself to begin donning the jewelry. First came the bracers, then the necklace itself. I’d half expected it to feel cold against my skin, but I was surprised to find that it was pleasantly warm. Perhaps, it had something to do with the fact that I’d used my magic to craft it? I wasn’t an expert on such matters. At some point, I would have to ask Twilight or Sunset. </p><p>Dalia helped me with my hair. We manipulated it into a stylized bun and used the clasp to keep it in place. Once that was finished, she fetched a few colorful parrot feathers to set in my hair at different intervals, in order to mimic the headdress of the priestesses. Lastly, I put on the earrings. For a brief moment, I considered wearing sandals but decided that they would ruin the aesthetic. I’d gone barefoot plenty of places before and I was quite comfortable doing so. I didn’t think that Orange Manor wouldn’t be too hard on my feet. </p><p>I gazed at my reflection in the mirror and was left speechless. I didn’t look at all like myself. Rather, I was like a vision straight out of the ancient jungle. I gasped when I felt warmth pour out of the necklace and envelop my entire being like a lover’s embrace. It was unlike anything I had experienced before or ever since. This only further reinforced my theory that the necklace had some kind of magical presence or, at the very least, minor properties. </p><p>“It’s absolutely stunning, Sombra. I don’t know what to say…” </p><p>Sombra smiled. “Then don’t say anything at all. Let your body do the talking.” </p><p>“Erm—yes, of course. Thank you again, darling.”</p><p>Sombra held up his finger. “Just remember: the paint is not water soluble. This is to ensure that it does not come off while you sweat. Whenever you wish to remove it, use the solution I provided. Above all else, have fun tonight. I will be at the Gala as well if you wish to chat. Who knows? Perhaps, I will be the one to bid on that remarkable necklace of yours.” </p><p>When he finally left the studio, I hopped up and down like a giddy schoolgirl. Not too much, mind you. I didn’t want to make my hair all ruffled and out of place. In just a few hours I would make my grand entrance at the Charity Gala. And hopefully, I’d make a name for myself as not only a talented jewelry maker, but a woman who wasn’t afraid to be bold and adventurous!</p>
