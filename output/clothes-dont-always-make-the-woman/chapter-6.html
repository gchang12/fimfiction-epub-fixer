		<h1>A Tropical Paradise Unlike Any Other (I)</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 6</b></p><p><i>Cala Concha, </i>Eastern Coast of Mareborne </p><p>It was with no small degree of trepidation that I left Extravagance behind in Manehatten. As much as I loved his company, the resort wasn’t what one would call pet-friendly. Plus, he never handled hot weather very well. With that in mind, I decided to ask Coco if she would doggie-sit my beloved companion while we were on vacation. She seemed amenable to the idea and I even left her with plenty of money to purchase supplies, grooming products, water, ect. The two of them had always gotten along swimmingly, so I wasn’t worried about him causing Coco any trouble. After giving Trav a big smooch, Braeburn and I set off to the airport.</p><p>We arrived in Mareborne without issue after a ten-hour flight. When one combined the jetlag along with the time difference, it made for a very weary pair of travelers. Even though we were on the verge of sleeping where we stood, the journey for us was far from over. <i>Cala Concha</i> was off the beaten path, as it were, so it took an additional hour-long drive by car to reach it from the airport. Fortunately, we had packed only what was strictly necessary. Naturist resorts were convenient in that regard. We didn’t need to waste any space for clothing or swimsuits. </p><p>A few years had passed since I last stepped foot on the grounds of <i>Cala Concha</i>. It was just as pristine and beautiful as I remembered. White sand beaches, palm trees, a refreshing breeze that tickled your skin, and crystal-clear water that was so clean it looked like a topaz. I took in a deep breath and relished the scents and sounds of the tropics. Braeburn seemed a bit more relaxed than I’d seen him in a long time, but I could tell he was radiating nervous energy just beneath the surface. I reached over and took hold of his hand, caressing it gently with my thumb. </p><p>“We talked about this, darling. There’s no need to be afraid.”</p><p>Braeburn let out a heavy sigh. “Ah know but… this is all so foreign ta me. Can’t help feelin’ a bit cautious over how everyone’ll react. Just gimme a second. Ah need ta collect mah thoughts.” </p><p>I frowned and looked out towards the sea. Logically, I knew there was absolutely nothing he needed to be nervous or embarrassed about. The simple fact of the matter was that Braeburn hadn’t grown up as a naturist. Casual nudity was still a deeply ingrained taboo from his perspective. I’d tried my best to get him accustomed to it over the past two weeks, but that was, more or less, in a private setting with just me. Being outdoors, amongst other guests, was a lot more intimidating. I grasped his hand tighter and we walked towards the main building. </p><p>As soon as we entered the lobby, I thought Braeburn was going to pass out. Not so much from the jetlag but of sheer embarrassment. Let’s just say that <i>Cala Concha</i> was about as casual as one could get regarding uniforms. It didn’t help matters that the blonde-haired receptionist was quite attractive. She had some of the perkiest breasts I’d seen in a while. What? Women are allowed to admire other women. It’s perfectly normal, I assure you. I couldn’t very well fault Braeburn for looking at them. They were directly in front of him, jiggling slightly while she spoke. </p><p>“G’day and welcome to <i>Cala Concha</i>. Do you have a reservation?” </p><p>“Good afternoon to you as well, darling,” I replied as I fished around in my handbag for the tickets, “Ah! Here they are. Would you be so kind as to direct us towards our room?” </p><p>The receptionist bowed slightly. “Of course, ma’am. Please follow me and I’ll escort you there.” </p><p>There weren’t a lot of people milling about the halls but we did run into a few other guests. Mostly middle-aged, perhaps a few younger children. Nothing terribly unusual for a naturist resort tucked away along one of Mareborne’s secluded coasts. I couldn’t help but notice that Braeburn was trying his absolute best not to stare at anyone and act as if nothing was awry. Suffice to say, he was doing a very poor job of it. My hope was that he would eventually get used to it and move on from the novelty of seeing everyone naked phase. </p><p>Once we arrived at our room, the receptionist reached into her fanny pack and handed me a pair of keycards. I thanked her, we went inside, and placed our luggage by the closet. I wasted no time kicking off my flip flops and slipping out of my sundress. Braeburn followed my lead, albeit at a slower pace. A thought suddenly occurred to me. With my fair complexion, the intense rays of the sunlight down here in the tropics would surely give me sunburn if I wasn’t careful. Sunscreen was an absolute must. And trust me, it would need to be applied everywhere. </p><p>I reached into my bag and took out a bottle of SPF 50. “The first rule of staying at a naturist resort is protecting your bare skin. I know exactly what you’re thinking right now and the answer is yes. We will need to apply it everywhere. I realize that doing so can be a bit awkward but it is absolutely necessary to avoid getting sunburnt.”</p><p>Being a seasoned professional at such things, I squirted a few globs onto the palm of my hand and made quick work of lathering it all over my body. I’d even brought along a long-handled loofa that was specifically designed to reach all of the difficult spots, such as my lower back and shoulders. I made sure to help Braeburn get a nice, even coating everywhere that I could. Well, everywhere except for his privates. I didn’t want to open that particular can of worms.  </p><p>For a moment, I considered wearing my favorite scrunchie, but decided against it. I preferred letting my hair down and Braeburn seemed to think it looked pretty, so I kept it that way. That only left eye protection. I found my designer sunglasses and propped them up in my hair until I needed to wear them. I handed Braeburn his own pair, which he donned immediately. </p><p>It wasn’t particularly bright indoors but one could easily get away with the aviator look in a place such as this. To be quite honest, I think he was wearing them more as a security blanket rather than for any practical purpose. It meant that he could avoid making eye contact with guests who happened to be walking by. No matter. Braeburn looked handsome regardless. </p><p>For the time being, I wasn’t terribly concerned about wearing sandals. The vast majority of people went barefoot at naturist resorts most of the time, so it’s not as though we would be breaking any social taboos by doing the same. Even in the dining areas and whatnot. I mean, come on now. It’s not as though there was any sort of dress code we needed to adhere to! </p><p>I took one final look in the bathroom mirror at myself. As a rule of thumb, I tried to keep my cosmetics to a bare minimum while I was on vacation. Just a light coat of lip gloss and smidge of navy-blue eyeshadow. That was all. I applied some lady’s antiperspirant to my underarms and placed a few dabs of perfume in all the strategic places. Perfect! Well… almost. </p><p>It was still bit disheartening to see how little my pubic hair had grown in since the Gala. I was no longer completely bare, but the only thing that covered my privates was a modest little wisp of royal purple. Of course, I always kept it tidy as befitted a lady. Some might even go so far as to say that the minimalist style was in vogue now. Braeburn’s hair, on the other hand, was thick and curly. Given how much body hair he had in general, I doubt he ever manscaped. </p><p>He padded into the bathroom and used some mouthwash while I rinsed my hands. “Braeburn, do mind if I ask you a personal question? You don’t have to answer it, but I am curious.” </p><p>He spit into the sink. “Sure. Don’t get much more personal than this…” </p><p>“Have you ever considered sprucing up your privates?” </p><p>Braeburn coughed awkwardly. “Say what now?”</p><p>“Trimming your pubic hair, darling. Have you ever given it any thought?” </p><p>Braeburn reflexively cupped his hands over his manhood. “Uh… can’t say Ah have.” </p><p>“I see. Well, I’m not suggesting that you shave all of it off. That would just be silly! However, it might be more hygienic if you trim up a bit. If you’re afraid of doing so, I would be more than happy to assist you. I’ve had a lot of experience keeping mine tidy.” </p><p>Braeburn blushed. “Yeah, I noticed…” </p><p>I crouched down on my haunches and twirled a strand of his pubic hair. “Oh ho~ So you admit that you’ve been looking down there, eh? What do you think of my kitty?” </p><p>“It’s just as pretty as any other part of ya.” Braeburn blurted out. </p><p>Feeling cheeky, I leaned forward and kissed his penis. “Thank you, dear. And I adore every part of you as well. What do you say? Are you interested in my proposal? I promise that it wouldn’t take very long and I’ll be gentle about it. All you have to lose is a little hair.” </p><p>Braeburn shuffled his feet. “Ah suppose. Just don’t make me look like a kid.” </p><p>With an excited squeal, I rushed over to my bag and dug out a bottle of hair removal cream. It was a lot safer to use than, say, a razor as it got rid of the hair at the follicle instead of causing little red bumps. It was a product specifically geared towards ladies, and thus had a floral aroma. Plumeria to be exact. Not the manliest scent, but it would have to do. </p><p>I instructed Braeburn to stand in the tub while I fetched a damp wash cloth. When I sat down in front of him and began rubbing the cream all over his fuzzy balls, he adopted the most peculiar expression. It was somewhere between pleasure and anxiety. Understandable, I suppose. He’d never experienced anything like this before. I made sure to be extra gentle and encouraging. At least he didn’t get an erection this time. That would have made things… awkward.  </p><p>In no time at all, his testicles and the area surrounding them were as smooth as polished glass. When it came to the pubic hair just below his waist, I used a special electric trimmer to cut it down to a more manageable length rather than remove it entirely. The end result left him with a rectangular patch of orange-blonde hair that served to accentuate his flaccid manhood and made him look much cleaner at the same time. I was quite proud of my handiwork!  </p><p>“What do you think? Do you like it?” </p><p>Braeburn studied his reflection in the mirror with a critical eye. “Erm—well, everythin’ feels a might breezier, Ah reckon. Didn’t realize how trimmin’ down made mah fellah look bigger.” </p><p>I giggled. “I assure you that it’s merely enhancing what’s already there, darling.” </p><p>Braeburn blushed furiously. “Thanks, Rarity. Ah think ya did a great job.”  </p><p>“Now that we’re all properly groomed and ready for adventure, what would you like to do first?” </p><p>Braeburn rubbed the back of his neck. “What about yer folks? Won’t they wanna know we’re here? Ah don’t mean ta sound like I’m patronizin’ ya, I just figured that’d be yer priority.”</p><p>I cursed underneath my breath. How could I have been so stupid? Of course, meeting my family should have been the first thing. There would be plenty of time later to engage in all the activities <i>Cala Concha</i> had to offer. Thinking fast, I texted Sweetie and asked her what room they were staying in. She replied near instantaneously and said that she had her own suite, while our parents were staying in another room. I had to admit that it was a bit unusual for father to give Sweetie so much leeway at a naturist resort, but perhaps he felt she deserved her own lodging. </p><p>“That’s odd. I was under the impression they were all staying together. But it would appear that my sister has her own room and my parents are staying on the floor just above it. I’ll ask Sweetie if we could all just meet together somewhere instead. That would make it easier.” </p><p>“The beach sure looked pretty. Wouldn’t mind goin’ fer a swim or a stroll.” </p><p>I clapped my hands together. “A marvelous idea, Braeburn! I’ll let her know.”  </p><p>Sweetie agreed that frolicking along the shore all afternoon was in line with what our parents wanted to do. I informed Braeburn what we were heading down to the beach and he packed a small tote bag with a few towels and some water bottles. Walking through the building with Braeburn at my side was a bit of an adventure in and of itself. His movements were stiff and unsure. The poor dear. Braeburn was likely under the impression that everyone was staring at his naked body, but that was most certainly not the case (<i>For the most part, anyway. He was exceptionally handsome</i>). I suppose it could have been worse. He could have refused to go out with me at all and locked himself away in our room instead.  </p><p>The great thing about <i>Cala Concha</i> was that it had a limited booking arrangement. In practical terms, this meant that only a certain number of guests were allowed to stay on site at any given time. It made the resort feel more personal and less crowded because the staff could actually focus their full attention on you. I think it was a plus for Braeburn as well, considering that this was his first time experiencing the naturist lifestyle in earnest. </p><p>We spotted my parents first; they were reclining, side by side, on a beach towel, underneath a large bamboo parasol. Father was burly, hairy, and fair-skinned like my sister and I. A bushy brown moustache graced his lips as always. Mother possessed a bubblegum pink complexion with hair colored similar to my own, only with streaks of grey mixed in. Her physique was, what many would consider, ‘<i>pleasantly plump</i>’. She was a professional baker and had given birth to two children, after all. They were your typical middle-aged, married couple except nude.  </p><p>When they saw us approach, Mother practically scrambled across the sand to greet me. As was her custom, she wrapped me up in a bone-crushing hug and smothered me with kisses. I returned her affection with equal warmth but much less enthusiasm. Most people would probably be embarrassed by such a display. As for me? I was used to it by now. </p><p>Father followed a few steps behind, a smile spread across his lips. I gave him a quick peck to the cheek and a hug as well. He returned it, but like I mentioned earlier, he was not the type of man who was keen on showing displays of public affection. Even with mother. That’s not to say they didn’t love each other. Heavens no! Nudity was one thing, but physical intimacy was another matter entirely. They liked to keep that aspect of their lives private. Not that I could blame them. </p><p>My father offered his hand to Braeburn once he put down the tote. “Ah~ So you’re the boyfriend we’ve heard so much about. My name’s Magnum Belle, but you can call me Dad if ya want.”</p><p>Braeburn shook his hand firmly and chuckled. “Pleasure ta meet ya, sir.”</p><p>My mother was next. Without even thinking about it, she hugged Braeburn like he was her own son. I tried not to laugh but the look on Braeburn’s face was priceless. I don’t believe he knew quite how to react to being smothered by curvaceous, middle-aged woman like my mother. Nonetheless, he was the perfect gentleman about it. He patted her back and stood next to me. </p><p>“Oh, my gosh! Braeburn’s even more handsome in person! And ya managed to get him to take off all of his clothes too. Yes, indeedy! You’ve got quite the catch there, Rare-Bear. Between you and me, you really ought to pop the question soon. He’s a keeper for sure!” </p><p>I blushed. “Mother, stop it! You’re embarrassing me!”</p><p>“Psshht. It’s my job to embarrass ya, sweetheart. C’mon and join us, young man. There’s no need to be a stranger. We’ve got plenty of room here for two more. Would you like something to drink? I brought along some homebrewed iced tea if you’re interested.”</p><p>“Uh… sure, ma’am. Iced tea sounds lovely.” </p><p>Mother giggled while she handed him a mason jar. “So polite too! It’s no wonder you managed to catch my daughter’s eye. Well, ya know, besides the equipment you’re lugging around.”</p><p>I blushed even harder and buried my face in my knees. Why did you have to bring <i>that</i> up, Mother?! Seriously, would it kill you to have a little tact sometimes?  I suppose I should have expected this sort of reaction. You can’t very well hide certain anatomical details when you’re walking around in the nude. At least she had the decency to employ a euphemism instead of calling Braeburn’s manhood for what it was. Ugh! That would have been dreadful! </p><p>“Oh? Well—um—the tote wasn’t all that heavy. Just put some towels in it fer the most part.” </p><p>Mother snorted with laugher. <i>NO! DON’T YOU DARE!</i> “I’m referring to your bait &amp; tackle, young man. No need to act so shy! We’re all human beings here. To be fair, you can see every nook and cranny of my middle-aged body, so why should we be afraid to talk about ourselves?” </p><p>Father placed his hand on her shoulder. “Now, sugarplum. Let’s not embarrass the poor boy too much. He isn’t a naturist, remember? I don’t want him to get scared off because—”</p><p>Mother gestured towards his manhood. &quot;What’s there to be scared of, dear? Your <i>Magnum PI</i> is dangling right out in the open too. I’m just trying to give Braeburn an honest compliment is all. I mean, I’m sure Rarity didn’t hook up with him just because of how thick his—”</p><p>Father blushed profusely. “We’re moving onto a different topic <b>NOW</b>! End of discussion!”</p><p>Mother simply shrugged and took a sip out of her own mason jar. Between the rest of us, I think our faces were red enough to resemble a grove of apple trees. I scooted closer to Braeburn and rubbed my hand along his thigh. He flinched ever so slightly, more due to the fact that his mind was elsewhere rather than being uncomfortable. As a sort of apology, I shrugged my shoulders and offered him a sheepish smile. He smiled back but avoided looking over at my mother. </p><p>“Daddy, am I to understand that Sweetie has her own room this year?” </p><p>Father nodded. “Yeah. She just turned sixteen not too long ago. I figured it was fair to start treating her like the young lady she’s become. Not that I didn’t before it’s just that… well, I care a lot about the both of ya. Don’t wanna see anyone get hurt or taken advantage of.” </p><p>“Darn tootin’,” Mother added, “You haven’t seen in her a while, but I assure ya that puberty’s hit Sweetie like a freight train. Your father’s worried all the boys will try to hit on her now that she’s got some womanly curves. Might even think she’s older than she looks. Those sorts of things.” </p><p>Braeburn sipped on his tea. “Ah know exactly what yer talkin’ about Mrs. Belle. Mah cousin AJ was a lot like that too when she was growin’ up. Although she can be a might dense when it comes ta womanly matters sometimes. Ah hope Sweetie ain’t that way.” </p><p>Mother waved her hand. “Please, I insist that you call me either Mom or Cookie. Mrs. Belle is way too formal, dear. And to answer your question, Sweetie is keenly aware of the changes going on with her body. More so than most of the girls around her age. I think it’s because she’s always nude at home like we are. Makes it easier to see. Hmm. I guess she would have known what to expect when Rarity went through puberty too. Who knows?” </p><hr/><p>As if summoned by magic, the very subject of our conversation emerged from the surf and walked over to where we were sitting. Upon seeing my teenage sister, I let out a quiet gasp. My parents weren’t kidding when they said she’d grown. Sweetie’s lanky, prepubescent body had filled out quite… generously. Her round, voluminous breasts (<i>easily two sizes larger than my own</i>) jiggled even with the slightest bit of movement. They were sure to make boys stare. </p><p>Sweetie’s hips, thighs, and bottom were also quite curvaceous. She wasn’t overweight by any means, but let’s just say that whatever fat she did possess went to all the right places. I could easily tell that she was physically active, as evidenced by her trim tummy and the lithe muscle tone that flexed just below the surface of her skin. A thick, curly tuft of pubic hair lie nestled in-between her legs. It was well groomed; a clear indicator of her womanliness. </p><p>No wonder my poor sister was having a teenage crisis. She had the figure of a professional magazine model! I glanced over at Braeburn and realized that he’d been staring at Sweetie as well (<i>even with sunglasses on, I could tell what direction his eyes were pointed</i>). I wanted to be angry with him for gawking at my baby sister, but then that would make me a hypocrite. </p><p>The good thing about Sweetie though was she had always been a modest and unassuming girl. She definitely wasn’t the type to flaunt her assets like some other unscrupulous characters I know. Even now, I could tell that she was blushing up a storm as her eyes wandered over to Braeburn. Attraction works both ways, it would seem. </p><p>“Hello, everyone. Did I miss anything?” Sweetie asked with an awkward smile. </p><p>I got up, walked over to my sister, and wrapped her in a warm hug. “It’s been a while, my dearest baby sister. How are you doing today?” </p><p>She shuffled her feet in the sand. “Ok, I guess. Is that guy sitting over there your boyfriend?” </p><p>“Yes, that’s Braeburn. He and I have known each other since we were teenagers, but I only recently started dating him. I wanted him to come along so that he could meet everyone.” </p><p>Sweetie pulled me aside, away from prying ears, leaned over, and whispered into my ear. “Why didn’t you tell me that your boyfriend was so hot?!!” </p><p>“I beg your pardon?” </p><p>Sweetie huffed. “I know you heard what I said the first time, Rarity! I thought it was just gonna be us as a family this time. Why didn’t you tell me that Braeburn was coming along? Because I would’ve put some makeup on or tried to make myself look more presentable…”   </p><p>“Trust me, darling. You really don’t need to worry about that.” </p><p>Sweetie blushed. “You m-mean… he was looking at me?” </p><p>“Yes! Honestly, Sweetie. What did you expect? I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to sound so harsh when I said that. I know you’ve been going through some personal issues regarding your body image.” </p><p>Sweetie sighed. “Yeah. That’s the understatement of the century.” </p><p>I gently rubbed her back. “We can talk about it in private later, if you’d like. I promise. But right now, isn’t the most appropriate time or place to do so. Let’s just act like everything is normal between us and go sit on the towel next to Mom &amp; Dad, ok?”</p><p>“Ok. Mom tried to talk to me about it at home earlier, but things just got way too weird. And Dad, well… he’s not exactly the greatest person to talk to about stuff like that.”</p><p>With one Sweetie Belle related crisis averted, we walked back to the spot where everyone was sitting and tried out best to act casual. Mother and Father gave us both a strange look, but I assured them that nothing was wrong and we were just having a typical sisterly spat. Nothing out of the ordinary. WAHAHA! Oh dear. It’s times like this that remind me how much of a terrible liar I am. Better than Applejack, but not by much. I really hope they didn’t see through it. </p><p>Father laid back and wrapped his arm around mother, pulling her closer to him. She sighed contentedly, rested her head against his shoulder, and began playing with a few strands of his chest hair. “Ain’t this the life, Cookie? Just lounging around on the beach all day, without a care in the world, next to the ones you love. A big margarita would make it perfect though.”</p><p>Mother placed a few kisses along his neck. “That could easily be arranged later, I’m sure. Just make sure ya save up some energy because we’re gonna be <i>VERY</i> busy tonight, mister~” </p><p>Our parents were at it yet again. Just to clarify: mother always liked to show her affection in the most direct (<i>and often public</i>) way possible. Father tended to take it in stride since he’d been married to her for so long. Besides, it’s not like they were hurting anyone or causing a ruckus by doing something naughty. You know what? I’d rather not think about my parents shagging in any way, shape, or form. Forget I even mentioned it. </p><p>While I was cuddling up against Braeburn, I noticed that Sweetie seemed a bit dejected. Upon thinking it over for a moment, I realized why she would be. Oh drat! She was at that awkward stage in one’s life when it seems like everyone else has a significant other and obtaining one is an insurmountable challenge. It hadn’t even occurred to me to ask her if she was interested in dating yet. Even if she was, who could possibly be a good match for her? I hadn’t heard Sweetie mention any male acquaintances that’d managed to pique her interest as of late.  </p><p>I reached over and rubbed her shoulder. “What’s the matter, darling? You seem upset.” </p><p>“Sorry. I’m just a little tired from all the swimming I did today. And I was thinking about some… stuff. Nothing you need to worry about, Rarity. I’m fine.” </p><p>I wanted to press her further, but I decided not to. At least not until I was certain that we were alone together. “I know what’ll put a smile on your face! Some ice cream. An old-fashioned tub of rocky road always does the trick with me. How about we head on over to the concession stand? My treat~” </p><p>Sweetie stared back at me with a deadpan expression. “You do know that all of the food around here is included in the ticket price, right?” </p><p>I’d completely forgotten that it was. I laughed off my faux pas. “Yes—well, it’s the sentiment that matters. Would you like to get ice cream with your big sister or not?” </p><p>“I dunno. I’m kind of watching what I eat right now. Besides, don’t you usually eat ice cream whenever you get super depressed? Like that time when you got dumped by your last boyfriend.” </p><p>My face flushed in a mixture of embarrassment and anger. “Sweetie Belle, you’re still a perfectly healthy, growing girl. You don’t have to worry about dieting just yet. One little ice cream cone isn’t going to kill you. We’re on vacation for heaven’s sake! Live a little.” </p><p>Sweetie eventually acquiesced <i>(not so much verbally but with a surly grunt</i>) and took a walk with me to the concession stand. I wasn’t too keen on leaving Braeburn alone with my parents, but I really needed to talk to my sister and figure out why she was being such a sourpuss. It was probably just her being an angsty teenager, dealing with typical teenage issues. Loathe as I am to admit it, I was once in her shoes. Erm—well, not literally… but you get the idea. </p><p>I settled on a small bowl of chocolate custard, while Sweetie got salted caramel fudge swirl with a pretzel cone. And to think, she’d just informed that me she was on a diet! You can’t pull the wool over my eyes, baby sister. We enjoyed our frozen treats together at one of the tables around the corner. Thankfully, the seats were cushioned with soft fabric. Not that horribly sticky faux leather stuff. Sitting on bare wood or metal is never a pleasant experience when one is nude.</p><p>“Are you enjoying your ice cream?”</p><p>Sweetie took another lick and nodded. “Yeah, it’s pretty good.” </p><p>“I’d rather not beat around the bush, so I’ll just come out and ask. What’s bothering you?” </p><p>Sweetie let out an exasperated sigh. “I don’t even know where to begin, Rarity.” </p><p>“Alright, then. Let’s trying going over your issues one thing at a time.” </p><p>Sweetie gestured to herself. “I’m sure you’ve noticed how my body has changed. Hah! It’s pretty much impossible to miss unless you’re blind. Anyway, the changes happened so fast that I… never figured out how to deal with them. Beforehand, I was just starting to get interested in boys but they never seemed to notice me. Now, they ogle me all the time… like I’m some juicy slab of steak! I might as well start calling myself ‘<i>Sweetie Cow</i>’. Look at how big my boobs are!” </p><p>I reached over and caressed her hand. “Yes, it seems as though you’re taking after mother in that regard. Pardon my frankness, darling but has anyone tried to molest you in any way?” </p><p>“No. I work out and practice kick boxing with Scoots at the gym every week. It’s a lot of fun. Oh! And I’ve gotten pretty good at it too. At least… that’s what she tells me. In any case, I know when people are being perverted creeps. I stay away from them as much as possible.” </p><p>I hummed in thought. “Good. I was worried about that. I’ll say this much, Sweetie. You’re transforming into a beautiful young woman. I know it can be difficult to endure all the lavicious stares, but you needn’t be ashamed of your body. The best advice I can give is that you should stop worrying about what other people think and own your look.”</p><p>“I get what you’re saying but it’s gonna take some time.”</p><p>I took another bite of my custard. “Understandable. I don’t expect you to do so overnight.”</p><p>Sweetie bit her lip. “The other thing is… I’m jealous.”</p><p>“I imagine I know the reason why, but humor me anyway.”  </p><p>Sweetie played with a strand of her hair. “I feel like I’m the odd one out.”</p><p>“Oh? In what way?” </p><p>Sweetie flushed a rosy shade of pink from her cheeks all the way down to the tops of her breasts. Probably more out of embarrassment and frustration than pure anger. Well, that’s what you get for dodging the subject, little sister. “C’mon, Rarity! You know exactly what I mean! I can’t believe that you’d try to—”</p><p>I booped her nose. “I’m doing this for your benefit, Sweetie. Assuming that I know what you’re thinking isn’t quite the same as <b>YOU</b> discussing it openly. Otherwise, it would defeat the purpose of our discussion. Go on, darling. Say it out loud. I promise that I won’t judge you. </p><p>“Ok, fine! I’m jealous that you have a hot boyfriend and I don’t. Are you happy now?! Look, it doesn’t help matters that you guys are being all snuggly and lovey-dovey. Mom and Dad too. Normally that wouldn’t bother me too much, but it makes me feel like I’m intruding.” </p><p>I put down my custard and gave Sweetie a hug. “I know it’s tough being a teenager. Especially, when your body is going through so many changes all at once. Not to mention the ridiculous volume of hormones pumping through your veins. It’s enough to drive anyone crazy. But I want you to know that we all love you, and enjoy your company.”</p><p>Sweetie’s voice cracked. “I know you do! That’s why I feel so bad about the way I’ve been behaving. Rarity, I’m trying my best to have fun and relax at the resort but it’s impossible for me not to think about all those things. UGH! Why does life have to be so complicated?!”</p><p>I kissed her forehead and began to run my fingers through her hair while I sat beside her. Sweetie immediately buried her head in-between my breasts and cried for a little while. I didn’t say anything more until she regained her composure a bit. Sometimes, it was best to just let these sorts of situations play themselves out. Especially, when it came to hormonal teenage girls. </p><p>“I know there aren’t very many guests staying at the resort right now, but isn’t there anyone else you could hang out with around your age?” I asked. </p><p>Sweetie nuzzled her cheek against my breast while I continued to play with her hair. The gesture wasn’t exactly what most people would consider appropriate between sisters. However, we’d grown up together in the nude and were used to various body parts being out in the open instead of covered by cloth. Neither of us felt that it was any more unusual than, say, a hug or a kiss. Besides, I enjoyed showing affection towards my baby sister and it helped calm her down.  </p><p>“How the heck should I know? We’ve only been here for like a day, tops. S’not the kind of thing I would bother looking up before going to a naturist resort.” Sweetie replied in a clipped tone.  </p><p>“I seem to recall that there’s a state-of-the-art entertainment pavilion near the main entrance.”</p><p>Sweetie frowned in confusion. “What’s that got to do with anything?” </p><p>“Well, if there’s any place around here that would appeal to teenagers…”  </p><p>Sweetie took in a deep breath and let it all out at once. “I guess there’s no harm in checking it out. Although, I’m not getting my hopes up. Adults are usually the ones who stay here, not teenagers. You know as well as I do how hard it is to find anyone our age who’s a naturist.”</p><p>“Fair enough. Why don’t you go ahead and visit the entertainment pavilion now? I’ll tell mom and dad where you are when I head back. At the very least, it’ll give you something to do instead hanging out with all of us all day, feeling like a third wheel.”</p><p>Sweetie got up out of her seat and used a napkin to blow her nose. “Are you sure? I got the impression that you wanted to spend some more time with me.”</p><p>“There will be plenty of time for catching up, dear sister. I want you to have some fun.” </p><p>Sweetie gave me another hug and kissed my cheek. “Ok. I’ll see ya later then.” </p><p>I smiled despite finding out that the remainder of my custard was a goopy mess. With a shrug, I simply slurped the rest of it down like a thick milkshake. I mean, it still tasted just as good, so why not? I sighed to myself after tossing the cup into the wastebasket. Sweetie did have a valid point earlier. It was downright impossible trying to find fellow naturist youths to mingle with at resorts such as this one. Given how expensive it was to plan and pay for a trip down here, grown adults were the bulk of the clientele. Even so, I hoped that Sweetie would find a new friend.  </p><p>When I finally returned to our little spot the beach, Braeburn looked like he was having a pleasant conversation with my parents. Thank goodness! I was worried that he would never loosen up. He patted the spot in-between his legs, inviting me to sit there. I wasn’t opposed to the idea, mind you. I simply wanted to avoid any situations that might cause him to get an erection, if possible. It’s not like he would be kicked off the beach if that happened, but he would never live down the embarrassment of having to walk back to our room with it bobbling around.</p><p>Braeburn wrapped his arms around my waist and kissed my neck. “Welcome back, Rares. Did ya have a good time with yer sister? She seemed kind of uncomfortable before y’all left.” </p><p>“We had a sisterly talk over some ice cream. Suffice to say, Sweetie was feeling a bit left out.” </p><p>Mother looked over at me and sighed. “Darn it! I had an inkling that she was still upset. I tried to talk to her about all that’s been going on but I suppose it wasn’t what she was looking for.” </p><p>“Please don’t blame yourself, Mother. I’m certain that you did the best you could. Sweetie simply required a more… nuanced approach. It’ll take some time, but I believe she’ll get through this rough spot feeling more confident about herself. Both physically and emotionally.”</p><p>Mother laughed it off, but I could tell that she felt bad about not being able to give her youngest daughter the advice she do desperately craved. “She’s lucky to have such a wonderful big sister.”</p><p>I blushed at the praise and tried to change the subject as quickly as possible. “So! Are there any interesting events coming up that we should be aware of?” </p><p>Father rubbed his chin. “As a matter of fact, there is. Tonight, there’s going to be a seafood bake around six and then a salsa dancing party afterwards. Your mother and I are looking forward to it! Why don’t the two of you come along as well? It’ll be fun!” </p><p>“Braeburn, darling. What do you think? Should we go?”</p><p>“Ah reckon it’s a possibility. Just so long as Ah can squeeze in a quick nap beforehand.” </p><p>As if on cue, I yawned at the thought of sleeping under the covers with my beau. “Hrmm. Yes, I think we could both use one. Goodness! The jetlag is really starting to hit me hard. Mother. Father. If it’s all the same to you, I think we’ll head back to our room now and get some rest.” </p><p>They both nodded in agreement. “No problem, Rare-Bear. See ya later tonight.”</p>
