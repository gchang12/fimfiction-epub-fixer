		<h1>How To Tame Your Dragon Lord</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 13</b></p><p>Lord Torch’s Chambers, Dragon Lands </p><p>According to Spike, since Lord Torch was not technically the acting Dragon Lord, he did not require a formal appointment to be seen. However, as was customary in the Dragon Lands, all dragonkind still referred to him by his title as a sign of respect. We were advised to do the same, lest we offend him. I suppose it wasn’t much different than my own world’s leaders. Despite what I’d heard about him via Spike, we didn’t want to just show up in his quarters unannounced. To that end, I insisted that he be told in advance of our intention to discuss the opal. </p><p>While our hooves clopped along the stony surface of a gigantic cavern, I looked back at Sunset and noticed that she seemed rather collected given our current situation. I, on the other hand (<i>hoof technically</i>), was about as nervous as one could be. My legs felt wobbly, my stomach was doing backflips, and I’m certain that I was sweating buckets underneath my fabulous coat. I tried to do some breathing exercises but it only resulted in me hyperventilating for a spell. I had to close my eyes for a moment to prevent myself from vomiting breakfast all over the ground. </p><p>Sensing my precarious emotional state, Sunset nuzzled her cheek against mine. “Relax, Rarity. I’m sure everything will be ok. It’s not like Lord Torch is a mountain sized monster who—ok, I forget I said that. From what I heard, he’s <i>MASSIVE</i>. Like, unbelievably huge.” </p><p>I scrunched my muzzle at her. “Sunset, darling, I appreciate what you’re trying to do but it’s quite simply <b>NOT</b> helping right now. Please be quiet so that I might pull myself together.” </p><p>Sunset chuckled awkwardly. “Uh… sure. I’ll just shut up.” </p><p>And just like that, we reached his quarters. My mind went blank when I finally laid eyes upon the monolith that was Lord Torch. He was far larger than any dragon I had seen so far, by an unimaginable margin. My mouth gaped open a few times while I tried to find the courage to speak to him directly. He took a few thunderous steps towards us and lowered his head down to our level. The former Dragon Lord snorted once and laughed. I nearly fainted on the spot. </p><p>“It would appear that you’re the guests Ambassador Spike told me about. Welcome to my humble abode. To what do I owe the pleasure?” </p><p>Sunset bowed. “Greetings, Lord Torch. My name is Sunset Shimmer and the crystal pony beside me is Rarity. We’ve come a long way to see you and were wondering if you might be able to share your insight with us. Concerning a certain… gem that we came across recently.” </p><p>Torch nodded. “Pardon my ignorance, but isn’t Lady Rarity one of your element bearers? And for the matter, isn’t she a unicorn? You see… ponies look so very similar to us dragons.” </p><p>“You’re not wrong, Milord. The Rarity you see before you hails from a different world.” </p><p>Torch rubbed his chin and hummed. “Interesting. What world might that be?” </p><p>“The one beyond the mirror portal. Perhaps, you’ve heard of it?” Sunset asked. </p><p>“Hmm. Only in passing. Such a thing was considered a mythical legend by our kind. Do you mean to say that it exists and is used for travel?”</p><p>Sunset rubbed the back of her neck. “Princess Twilight keeps it in her castle now. The portal itself connects to a world full of ape-like creatures called humans. Rarity, as it so happens, was born there and is one of their kind. We found a strange opal in that world and came here to inquire about it. You know, since you’re so ol—wise, we figured you might know something.” </p><p>Torch ruffled his wings and chuckled. “Indeed? You needn’t be shy about telling the truth, little ponies. I am ancient by anyone’s standards.”</p><p>Sunset nudged my rump, sending me stumbling forward like a newborn foal towards the reptilian behemoth. When I finally found the courage to speak, my voice cracked loudly like a teenager’s, causing a pinkish blush to spread across my coat. “Good day to you, Milord. I am Rarity Belle, owner of the opal in question. A pleasure to meet your acquaintance.” </p><p>Torch offered me a polite, tooth-filled smile. “The honor is all mine. I can’t recall the last time I hosted a trans-dimensional traveler. So, what can you tell me about this gem of yours? I can’t promise I have the answers you’re looking for, but I’ve seen a great many things during my prolonged existence on this planet. Ask away, little mare.” </p><p>I cleared my throat. “Ah, yes. I found a rather large, pristine opal in an underwater cave while I was exploring a beach. Mind you, I already had a magic geode attuned to my will before I even found the gem. Somehow, when I touched the opal it fused with the geode and with me.” </p><p>“Dearest, please come see our visitors.” Torch bellowed. </p><p>Mere moments later, a dragoness nearly as large as Torch came ambling into the room. She had a lovely mauve coat of outer scales with aquamarine scales lining her belly. In contrast to Torch’s craggy, muscular form, her body was sleeker, and distinctly feminine. She looked down at me with her ruby red eyes in what I can only assume was a curious expression. I curtsied out of respect and tried my best to show her an award-winning smile. </p><p>“Well, isn’t she the loveliest little thing? Looks just like an opal. One must wonder if she tastes like one too.” The dragoness remarked with an amused grin. </p><p>Torch entwined his tail with hers, in what I could only assume was a form of draconic affection. “The mares below us are named Rarity Belle and Sunset Shimmer. They came to visit us from another world! Since you know so much about gems, I figured that you’d like to be the one to discuss the matter with her. Ponies! This is my lifemate, Violet. She is also Ember’s mother.” </p><p>My ears folded downwards when she lowered her head to get a closer look at me. “Thank you for the kind words, Milady. Like I was telling your—erm—lifemate earlier, I found some sort of a magic opal in an underwater cavern and it somehow fused with me. I was wondering if you might know anything about it?”</p><p>Violet tapped her index claw against her chin. “I might. But I must warn you, Rarity Belle. The story I am about to tell you is ancient and shrouded in myths and legend. For all we know, it might very well be fictional rather than historical fact at this point.”</p><p>I sat down on my rump and tapped my hooves together. “Be that as it may, any information you can provide us will be useful. Please, do go on by all means.” </p><p>Violet took in a deep breath and adjusted her wings. “Many millennia ago, there lived an ancient seafaring race of earth ponies known as the <i>Orestae</i>. You may know their descendants as Crystal Ponies. The <i>Orestae</i> were masters of trade, shipbuilding, and their craftsmanship knew no equal in the ancient world. As such, their coastal kingdom soon grew vast and wealthy.</p><p>“However, as with any burgeoning empire, many of their neighbors became jealous and their enemies multiplied over the ensuing decades. The opal was their solution to containing them. That is to say, it was designed to be the ultimate artifact capable of creating anything it’s user desired. In those days it was known as the ‘<i>Forge Stone</i>’. Limited only by one’s imagination.” </p><p>I nodded slowly. “Yes, that makes perfect sense. When I was back at my workshop making a piece for auction, it was as if I could create things merely by thinking. I suppose, if I put my mind to it, I could also create weapons with my experience. Not that I would, mind you.” </p><p>Violet swished her tail back and forth. “What you claim is consistent with the stories. However, I only heard them from the dragon elders when I was but a hatchling. The events of that bygone era are considered ancient even to Torch and I.”</p><p>Sunset raised her hoof. “So, how ancient are we talking?” </p><p>Torch scratched his head. “At least ten thousand years, perhaps more.” </p><p>Sunset frowned. “Damn. That is old. No wonder nobody knows anything more than stories about the stupid thing. Rarity, what do you make of the opal? Do you think it’s legit?” </p><p>I bit my lip. “Honestly, dear, I’m not sure. I can only tell you how it felt and what I experienced. And my instincts are telling me that what is now currently a part of my physical being is, as you so aptly put it, legit. My only suggestion would be to perform some more tests to be certain.” </p><p>Violet tapped her claws against the ground. “If it’s any consolation, I can smell the pony magic radiating from your tiny, little body. Powerful magics at that. Hmm. Not unlike that of an alicorn, but unique in its own way. Most curious.”</p><p>“How is that even possible? I didn’t realize that magic had a scent.” </p><p>Violet lowered her head and stared at me. “It is an innate ability that all dragons possess. We can tell which creatures have what type of magic. Useful for hunting and protecting ourselves from powerful foes. Again, I must stress that your scent is typical of a Crystal Pony, but intertwined within is something that I cannot place my claw on. It is without doubt, very powerful though.” </p><p>Sunset tapped my shoulder and sighed. “I’m sorry that we couldn’t get more useful information, Rarity. I feel like this whole trip was just a big waste of time.”</p><p>I nuzzled her cheek. “I wouldn’t say that, darling. At least we know that the opal was some kind of ancient superweapon. My goodness! I can’t imagine my life will resemble anything close to normalcy after this. I suppose that magic shall simply be an intrinsic part of my very being from now on. Even though I’d rather just be plain, old Rarity Belle instead.” </p><p>Sunset returned my nuzzle with equal fervor. “Where’s the fun in being boring?”</p><p>I pawed at the ground. “I suppose so. Pardon my curiosity, Violet. But do you know what happened to the <i>Orestae</i>? Surely, an empire as vast as theirs should have ruins somewhere.”</p><p>The dragoness snorted. “You would think. However, the fall of their empire was swift and all encompassing. Little did those ponies know that the capital of their empire was settled near a hyper-volcanic island. It erupted in a great cataclysm, sending massive tsunamis along the cost and burying the land beyond deep in pumice and ash. Few survived, let alone structures.” </p><p>I felt my stomach drop. “Oh, how dreadful! Those poor souls…” </p><p>“Sounds an awful lot like Atlantis, except with ponies.” Sunset commented. </p><p>“Do you think it could be related? I mean, the opal got to our world somehow.” </p><p>Sunset shrugged. “I’m no archeologist, but it’s possible. Perhaps, the reason why people haven’t ever found Atlantis is because it was never in the human world to begin with. That just leaves the question as to how they managed to cross the dimensional boundary.” </p><p>My eyes widened in understanding. “<b>THAT’S IT</b>!!”</p><p>“Uh… Rarity? Care to elaborate?” </p><p>“Violet said that the opal could create anything, right? What if a group of survivors used it to make a portal of some kind? But rather than a single mirror portal, it must have been much larger in order to accommodate a ship. What do you think, Violet?”</p><p>The dragoness crunched on a chunk of iron ore. “Oh, pardon me. I was just enjoying a little snack while you two conversed. Even if the opal was capable of creating a dimensional portal, the one wielding it needed to have the accompanying knowledge to construct it properly. That is why the Forge Stone is so selective about who it allows to wield its power.”</p><p>My ears pointed upward while I stomped my hooves on the ground. “But I thought you said it was only limited by a person’s imagination?!”</p><p>Violet let out a bellowing growl-laugh. “So, I did. Allow me to clarify. Powerful magic artifacts have a certain level of sapience within them. Not true intelligence like living creatures, mind you. They can sense who is the most appropriate wielder for their designated purpose. In your case, I suspect the Forge Stone chose you because of your abilities as a metallurgist.” </p><p>“You mean, it was just waiting to bond with someone like me? Because why else would it have called out to me, specifically? Damn it all! I’m so tired of all these magical shenanigans…” </p><p>Violet shrugged her wings. “I am not an expert on such matters, but it would appear so.” </p><p>I let out a frustrated whinny. “Why must destiny be so cruel to me? <b>WHHYYYYYY</b>?!!” </p><p>Sunset stroked my back with her hoof. “C’mon, Rarity. Don’t look an artifact in the—you know what, that expression doesn’t really work. Look, there’s no law that says you have to follow some grand, heroic path. Just use the stone for creating jewelry and other artsy stuff. Honestly, I don’t think its creators would mind that at all. They were master craftsponies, remember.” </p><p>I felt my entire body sag. All of the stress, fatigue, and sleepless nights aboard the airship seemed to catch up with me all at once. It nearly overwhelmed me. I could barely muster the strength to respond to my fiery-maned friend. “Very well then. I don’t see any way to separate the Forge Stone from my body at this point. I might as well accept that it’s a part of me now.” </p><p>Much to my surprise, the Dragon Lord and his wife were very accommodating hosts. They offered Sunset and I a selection of smoked cold cuts (<i>which we told them was ok</i>), assorted fruit, and cheeses to nibble on for lunch while we took some time to just decompress and relax. While Sunset was sipping on some ale, a burst of green fire signaled a letter from Spike. I let out a very lady-like scream and choked on my apple juice. Somehow, she was able to receive them. </p><p>“Could you please warn me the next time you get one of those blasted things?! You know that I get startled quite easily whenever anything involves magic.” </p><p>Sunset snicked. “Sorry. I wasn’t expecting him to send a letter to me here. Hmm. Let’s see… Spike says that Lord Ember is due to arrive any minute now. Apparently, she wants to see us off or something to that effect. I’ve never met her personally, but Twi says she’s cool.” </p><p>Speak of the devil, the lithe blue dragoness came padding into the chamber no sooner had Sunset finished her flagon of ale. For some reason, I immediately sensed that something was off. I don’t really know how to explain it. A primal sensation of impending dread, deeply rooted within the subconscious mind. Not from me, but the Forge Stone… somehow. I tried my best to project feelings of calm and peace, letting the artifact know that Ember meant no harm to us. It was then that I noticed the Bloodstone Scepter’s massive ruby began to emit a harsh glow. </p><p>Ember’s wings flared. “Hey! Quit it you! I’m not—DAD, what’s going on?” </p><p>Torch grumbled. “I’m not sure, Ember. I’ve never seen it react this way before.” </p><p>Before I knew it, my body felt feverishly hot. Energy raced through my veins like a bolt of lightning, which frightened the living daylights out of me. Then, my body became more translucent and emitted a glow not unlike an opal in the sun. Just what the hell was happening to me? It’s not like I was doing any of this on purpose. I sent a flurry of angry questions to the Forge Stone, demanding an answer. To my surprise, it actually sent me an answer. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#265DAF">Bloodstone. Predators. Danger. Must </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#265DAF">protect end</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#265DAF"> user</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#265DAF">. </span></p><p>“What on earth are you talking about,” I shouted, “We aren’t in any danger! The dragons have been courteous to us the entire time, you stupid <b>ROCK</b>!”</p><p>I could tell that Sunset was trying to keep her cool but she still looked worried. “Ok, Rarity. Calm down. Let’s just take a second and try to analyze the situation before things go FUBAR.” </p><p>Ember had no choice but to relinquish the Bloodstone Scepter as it began to float on its own accord. “Seriously! This is not cool! I command you to stop… whatever it is that you’re doing! I am the Dragon Lord! You’re supposed to do what I say.” </p><p>A wave of ruby red energy pulsed from the scepter, which surrounded the dragons with a shield and immobilized them temporarily. Oddly enough, it had no effect on Sunset or I. Mere moments later, a similar pulse, expect a rainbow-hued one that came from my body, echoed through the room. A tremendous headache wracked my skull, bringing me to tears. I wailed unashamedly like a child because I just couldn’t stand the electric pain that shot through every nerve ending in my body. Why? What was going on? Why was I having so much trouble moving my limbs? It was as if I was no longer in control of my own faculties. I cursed the Forge Stone once more. </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#5E51A3">I must insist that you stop this at once! You’ll end up hurting everyone</span><span style="color:#5E51A3">. </span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#265DAF">Unable to comply </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#265DAF">with end</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#265DAF"> user’s request. Initiating countermeasure sequence</span><span style="color:#265DAF">. </span></p><p>I screamed while I was lifted higher and higher into the air by the sheer volume of mystical energy flowing through my body. The rainbow aura seemed to have surrounded Sunset too, as she flailed about, trying to use her own magic to counteract the involuntary spell being cast throughout the entire cave. It was no use. The Forge Stone’s power was simply too great for us to counter. I could scarcely think straight as the room began spinning around, making me feel dizzy. My body grew even hotter and then… in a blinding flash of rainbow light we disappeared from the cave. To where, I had no idea. Everything lost its meaning when we slipped into unconsciousness. I can only hope that we weren’t vaporized by the Forge Stone. </p><hr/><p>There was no telling how much time had passed since the incident. However, the one thing I knew for certain was that I could feel pain. Seeing as how such a thing wasn’t possible if one were dead or in a dream, I had to assume that I was still counted amongst the living. I opened my eyes slowly, rubbed my temples, and groaned in agony when a fresh wave of pain assaulted my senses. My head hurt—nay—my entire body seemed to have a deep ache about it. The sensation was so overwhelming that I proceeded to vomit my lunch quite ferociously. Thus weakened, I collapsed onto the cool grass beneath me and began to cry. </p><p>Wait a moment. Grass. Yes, I was laying atop a bed of grass. It took me far longer than I cared to admit, but I lifted my hand in front of me and wiggled my fingers. Apparently, I was back in my natural form, or I should clarify that it was my <i>au naturale</i> form. Somehow, the Forge Stone had managed to change me back into a human at some point. I surveyed my surroundings and realized that I was in the middle of a forest or at the very least, a nature park of some sort. Still lacking the energy to walk properly, I managed to sit up and take stock of my situation. </p><p>The first thing I noticed was that it was the dead of night and a bit chillier than I preferred. Patently obvious, right? You know, given the fact that I was bereft of clothing. I suppose it would have been too much to ask the Forge Stone to conjure me a hoodie and a pair of jeans. That said, I didn’t waste any more time lamenting my state of undress and instead, focused on finding Sunset. She had to be nearby, if her inclusion in the spell was any indication. </p><p>I heard, rather than saw, my fiery-haired friend at first. She sounded close by, so I investigated a small clearing in the brush and found her curled up in the fetal position, skin glistening with sweat in the moonlight. I rushed to her side and lifted her head up. She blinked a few times, as if trying to determine if I was real or just a fever-induced vision. I ran my fingers through her hair. </p><p>“Take it easy, dear. Don’t try to exert yourself.” </p><p>“Rarity? Is that you? Where… are we?” Sunset croaked. </p><p>“I haven’t the foggiest clue. But it would appear that we are, once again, human.” </p><p>Sunset wiggled her toes and let out a weak chuckle. “Heh. How lucky can two girls be? That stupid rock just decided to randomly dump us somewhere, naked, in pain, and confused. If that thing had an ass, I’d be sure to kick it. Ugh. Do you think we might be in the human world?” </p><p>“I suppose it’s possible, given our current state. However, I haven’t seen anything obvious that would indicate our precise location. Drat! What I wouldn’t give for my smartphone right now!” </p><p>Sunset closed her eyes for a moment. “Shit. I feel like death warmed over. By the way, in case you were curious, this is exactly what it’s like to experience a magic hangover. I must’ve used more power than I thought trying to keep us anchored to Equestria. Then again, I shouldn’t be surprised that the Forge Stone trumped my spell. That thing had Alicorn levels of magic.” </p><p>I furrowed my brow in confusion. “Pardon my ignorance, but do you mean ponies with wings and horns like Princess Twilight? I’m not intimately familiar with all of the races in Equestria.” </p><p>“Yeah. It’s not just the visual differences. Alicorns are way more powerful than any other race. It’d be like comparing a firecracker to a nuke, in terms of explosive potential. Granted, I was considered an extremely gifted caster by Equestrian standards… but it just wasn’t enough.”</p><p>I felt my stomach twist in an icy knot. Then the hyperventilating began anew. “I have that much power stored inside me now?! What—I don’t—what if something goes terribly wrong? What if I can’t control it? <b>I DON’T WANT TO BE VAPORIZED IN A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION</b>!!” </p><p>Sunset placed her hand on my thigh and caressed it as a gesture of reassurance. “Trust me, Rarity; that won’t happen. The Forge Stone may be a ridiculously powerful artifact, but it was made by the most skilled artisans the ancient world had to offer. Did you… ever hear it speak?”</p><p>“I beg your pardon?” </p><p>Sunset coughed once, then smacked her lips. “It’s like Violet said. The most powerful artifacts have a crude form of sapience. They… choose their users and only obey the commands of those they find worthy. Since it’s a part of you now, it should have access to your mind.”</p><p>I repositioned Sunset’s head, so that she could rest on my lap. “Come to think of it, I did hear something while we were in the cave. It warned me that the dragons were dangerous. But what I don’t understand is why it only did so when Lord Ember entered the room.” </p><p>Sunset’s eyes widened as she gasped. “The Bloodstone Scepter. Even the dragons don’t know exactly how ancient it is or when it was originally created. But if I had to bet, I’d say that the Forge Stone recognized its power, and considered it a threat to us. Since we were ponies…” </p><p>I sighed. “We can sort out all of the details with Princess Twilight and Lord Ember later. For now, our priority is to figure out where we are and receive medical attention. That is, assuming, we aren’t arrested for indecent exposure or considered a couple of raving lunatics first.”</p><p>Sunset chuckled weakly. “See, this is what I’ve been talking about for years. Humans are way too uptight about the whole nudity taboo. It’s just skin. What’s the harm in showing some?”</p><p>“Well, I agree with you on that matter but I don’t make the laws around here. Are you able to walk or do you need to rest for a while longer, darling?”</p><p>Sunset grunted in pain as she rose to her feet. “For the record, I’m going to say that this is about as pleasant as diving headfirst into a pool full of broken glass and lemon juice. Ngh. What I wouldn’t give for a couple of extra-strength aspirin right now. Alright. Enough bitching. Let’s get this show on the road. I’ll manage well enough, I guess.” </p><p>It didn’t take long for me to recognize where we were. Within a few steps, we discovered a paved path and the electric lamps that lined it along the way. Given, what I could only assume, was the late hour, there wasn’t a single soul around in the immediate vicinity. Both a blessing and a curse for us. My suspicions were confirmed when we happened upon the public restroom. This was indeed Greenway Park. The Forge Stone had dropped us in the middle of Manehatten. </p><p>While Sunset splashed her face with warm water from the sink, I gently rubbed her back. “I’m afraid that I have some—ah—interesting news to share. I know precisely where we are but… getting help might prove challenging.” </p><p>“Why’s that?” </p><p>I shuffled my feet and twirled a strand of my hair. “We’re in the middle of Greenway Park, darling. The good news is: Coco’s apartment is close by. The bad news is: we’re a couple of young, attractive, naked women wandering around a major urban center in the dead of night.” </p><p>I became a bit flustered when Sunset decided to make use of one of the toilets and take a quick potty break. She didn’t even bother to close the stall door. Apparently, doing her business in front of others didn’t faze the woman in the least. “Man, that ale went right through me. I mean, who knows how long we were unconscious. Could’ve been hours. Anyway, I see your point. If we’re not careful, we might get taken advantage of by some unscrupulous character.”</p><p>“I’m proficient in Jiu Jitsu but I’m not sure that shall be enough to defend our honor if we get into a spot of trouble. Oh, what I wouldn’t give for a taser or even a bottle of pepper spray!” </p><p>Sunset cocked her brow while she finished cleaning up. “Why not just use your geode powers?” </p><p>I blushed profusely. For one, because I hadn’t even considered using my geode, and well… when I actually tried to summon my abilities, they didn’t respond whatsoever. The resulting effort only managed to worsen my pounding headache. “No use, I’m afraid. This has never happened to me before. I can’t seem to get my magic to function properly. Any suggestions?” </p><p>“Looks like you’ve got magic exhaustion too. Can’t say I’m surprised. Trans-dimensional spells are a doozy, as Pinkie would say. Uh—not our Pinkie, but the other Pinkie. The earth pony one.” </p><p>I waved my hand. “Of course, she said that. Well then, it would appear that we are on our own for the time being. We must use our combined wits and guile instead of magic. Tally ho!”</p><p>Sunset stood on her tip-toes and peered out the window. “Like you mentioned earlier, the park is practically deserted at this hour. No surprise, given that it’s one thirty in the morning. Even so, we need to be careful and not draw any attention to ourselves. Stay in the brush, off the paths.”</p><p>I nodded in agreement. “Indeed. Coco’s apartment isn’t very far from the edge of the park. But we’ll still have to cross the street in order to get there. Not to mention, somehow find a way up to the tenth floor, rouse her from slumber, and explain everything that happened. All whilst in the nude. Wahaha! No challenge at all I say! Easy as a summer breeze!” </p><p>Sunset scratched her head. “Hmm. Yeah, that’s gonna be a problem alright. We’ll just have to cross that bridge when we get there and hope that luck is on our side.” </p><hr/><p>By some miracle, lady luck must have favored us. We didn’t run into so much as a mouse while we crept along in the bushes and trees, edging ever closer to the street. The darkness helped to conceal our naked bodies, even if someone happened to catch a glimpse of us. Mostly because we made damn sure to keep our distance from any streetlamps that might alert anyone to our presence. I let out an excited (<i>if premature</i>) squeal when we finally reached the limit of Greenway Park. I could literally see our salvation across the street. Now, came the tricky part. </p><p>Sunset tapped my shoulder. “Look, I know this is supposed to be dangerous but, I—uh—I’m kind of excited at the same time. Once this is all over, I’m going to town with the fattest dildo I can get my hands on. What? Don’t you dare judge me, Rarity! Sex helps relieve my stress.” </p><p>I groaned while rubbing my temples. “Focus, Sunset. You can pleasure yourself as much as you wish once this whole sordid affair is behind us. Ok, here’s the plan: we’ll cross the street as quickly as we are able. Just make sure not to injure yourself in the process. Pavement is very unforgiving to bare skin. Then, we’ll make our way behind Coco’s apartment building.” </p><p>Sunset pointed towards the building. “You mean that spooky, super creepy unlit alleyway?” </p><p>I crossed my arms underneath my breasts and huffed. “Well, do you have any better ideas? Go on, Sunset. I’ll all ears. Let’s hear what brilliant solution you have to propose instead.”</p><p>Sunset’s cheeks flushed rosy pink. “No, I don’t. Rarity, I’m trying my best to be brave but this is just about one of the craziest things I’ve ever done. Uh… sans being a magical she-demon, fighting a plant monster of the Everfree, and other Equestrian hijinks. I’m scared, ok?”</p><p>“And I’m sorry for losing my temper with you. This whole ordeal is frightening to me as well. I just want to be safe and enjoy the comforts of my own home again. Preferably, starting with a hot bath. I can’t imagine how filthy we are, traipsing about in the brush and mud. Let’s just hope that Coco is either already awake or easy to rouse. I’d rather not clamber up the fire escape…” </p><p>Sunset’s eyes narrowed. “At two in the morning?”</p><p>“Yes, she can be a night owl on occasion. Coco claims it’s when her muse is most active. Personally, I prefer to work early in the morning myself. But to each their own, I suppose.” </p><p>The former unicorn simply grunted in response. With nothing more to be said on the matter, we stuck close to one another and ran across the street as quickly as our bare feet would allow. Which is to say, not fast enough for my liking. When we finally reached the alleyway, the both of us hugged and celebrated our small victory. Despite everything having gone as smoothly as one could hope for thus far, I had a sneaking suspicion that we weren’t out of the woods yet. </p><p>Before I could curse Murphy and his insipid law, we spotted a group of thuggish brutes huddled together a bit further down the alleyway. Ironically, they were right in front of the apartment complex’s back entrance. There was no doubt in my mind that something shady was going on but Sunset and I had little choice other than to bide our time and wait for them to leave. While we hid behind the relative safety of a dumpster, we listened in on their conversation. </p><p>“How many times have we been over this, Joe? If you can’t pay the tribute you owe to the family, we take it outta your hide. Simple. Easy ta understand. So, where’s the dough? And I ain’t talkin’ about the kind ya make doughnuts outta. No excuses this time.” </p><p>A middle-aged, brown-haired man dressed in chef’s attire knelt before the lumbering mobster, his hands bound behind his back and a pistol pointed to his temple. “Lorenzo, I paid as much as I could. It’s just that the shop hasn’t been turning as much of a profit lately. You understand, right? I got a wife and kid to feed…” </p><p>The slick haired mobster clicked his tongue while he cocked the pistol. “Sure, I believe ya. The younger crowd are into the paleo diet or whatevah the hell they call it. Nobody wants ta eat sweet, delicious doughnuts for breakfast anymore. That’s why ya gotta diversify, Joe. It’s one of the most basic principles of capitalism. You know I’m a reasonable man, but the boss ain’t. He tells me ta shake ya for the money, I gotta do what I’m told or I get whacked.” </p><p>Joe began to sob quietly. “Please. I just need a little bit more time. That’s all I ask!” </p><p>Lorenzo sighed. “Honest ta Pete! Quit the waterworks already! The thing is, Joe, we already gave ya an extension last week. Ya should be grateful the boss even allowed that. Were we in a saner world, I’d just beat the shit outta ya as a warning and leave. <b>BUT</b>! The boss has lost his patience. So, either ya cough up the green or die. C’mon, Joe. Don’t make me pop a round in your skull. I really don’t wanna. It’s messy and my boys will have ta clean up afterwards.” </p><p>“Sunset, what are we going to do,” I hissed, “We can’t just let them kill that poor man!” </p><p>“In case you haven’t noticed, we’re not in the best position to be helping anyone right now. What, do you think those goons will let him go just because a couple of crazy naked chicks jump out from behind a dumpster and ask politely? Yeah, I don’t think so, Rarity.” </p><p>My shoulders sagged. “But they’ll murder him…”  </p><p>Sunset let out a frustrated groan. “Well, life sucks sometimes. Even if we wanted to help that guy, we don’t have anything resembling a weapon to defend ourselves with. Not to mention, charging in there would just get us both shot to pieces. What do you propose we do, Rarity? I’d like to help him but not without a solid plan first.” </p><p>“I have an idea but I’m not sure it will work.” </p><p>Sunset rubbed my back encouragingly. “Oh, yeah? Let’s hear it.” </p><p>“The Forge Stone. If I can somehow call upon its power, my skin will become as hard as diamond. Theoretically, they shouldn’t be able to harm me if I am able to do so. Perhaps… I might even be able to knock them out too? Don’t look at me like that! It’s worth a try!”</p><p>Sunset grit her teeth. “Ok. I guess we don’t have any other options. Just promise me that if you can’t get the Forge Stone to work, don’t do anything rash or stupid. This isn’t a fight we can win without magic on our side, Rarity. I—um—don’t want to lose you…” </p><p>I wrapped my friend in a bone-crushing hug. “Thank you, darling. It means so much to hear you say that. But I shall endeavor to save that man to the best of my ability, regardless of the odds.”</p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#5E51A3">Forge Stone, are you still there? I’m sorry for being so cross with you earlier. It’s just that you used my body without my express consent. That’s</span><span style="color:#5E51A3"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#5E51A3">not the sort of behavior I’m able to tolerate.</span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#265DAF">Duly noted but irrelevant. Safety of the end user is my primary objective</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#265DAF">. </span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#5E51A3">Fine. But we shall have a long discussion about this later! In any case, I was wondering if you might be able to harden my skin like before. Do you have enough magic left to do so?</span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#265DAF">Affirmative. Magic stores nominal. Does the end user wish to execute a command?</span></p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#5E51A3">Yes, darling. Do it quickly. I’m afraid we don’t have much time left…</span></p><p>Unlike before, the transformation was far less dramatic. In a mere instant, I felt a pleasant warming sensation wash over my skin and watched as it glowed that lovely rainbow hue. Not exactly what I would call inconspicuous, but a lady must be willing to make such sacrifices in the name of justice. With renewed determination, I charged ahead and stood before the group of mobsters. I must have been quite the sight, for they all started at me with stupefied expressions. </p><p>“I demand that you release that gentleman at once!” </p><p>Lorenzo directed his attention towards me. “What the actual fuck? Why should I listen ta a sparkly, naked bitch like you? Not sure if that’s body glitter or whatever. I don’t care. Get her boys! Maybe we can have a little fun taking turns with her while we’re at it too. Joe can wait.” </p><p>I struck what I assumed must have been a heroic pose. Lessened, perhaps, by the fact that I was nude and in the middle of a dark alley. “Have it your way, scoundrels. <i>HEEEEYAHHHH</i>!”  </p><p>With all the grace of a prancing gazelle (<i>thankfully</i>), I leapt through the air and managed to bring my foot down on the first thug. I winced when I felt his collar bone shatter underneath my foot. He let out the most wretched howl of pain afterwards. Not that I blame him, of course. Injuries of that magnitude must have been incredibly painful and difficult to deal with. Even though he was a scallywag, I couldn’t help but feel guilty for hurting him in such a way. After all, I hadn’t put much strength into my kick. Why had it given him such a grievous injury? </p><p><span style="font-style:italic;color:#265DAF">Your skin is harder than their bones by several magnitudes</span>. The Forge Stone answered. </p><p>I paused for a moment. “Ah, yes. I suppose I should be more careful then.” </p><p>The second assailant was not taking any chances with me. He whipped out a rather large knife and tried to plunge it into my abdomen. Unfortunately for him, the tip snapped like a twig and left him with little more than a useless pommel to wave around. Rather than hit the man directly, I slipped behind him while he was distracted and put him in a chokehold. Within moments, he was unconscious and out of the fight. Only one thug remained standing: Lorenzo. </p><p>“I didn’t sign up for this crazy bullshit! What, are ya some kinda self-righteous vigilante allergic to clothes? Well, whatever. Doesn’t matter at this point. I gotta kill ya. What a fucking waste. You’re smoking hot but a nutjob I don’t wanna deal with. Bye, lady. It was nice seeing ya!” </p><p>Lorenzo didn’t even hesitate emptying his pistol into me. The nine-millimeter rounds ricocheted off of my bare breasts as if they were bullet-proof body armor, making dull thud noises as they did so. Oddly enough, it did cause me a little bit of pain but like that of a bee sting rather than a grievous chest wound. When he finally ran out of ammunition and realized that shooting me was pointless, the raven-haired mobster tried to full body tackle me into submission.  </p><p>With a girlish scream, I tumbled to the ground while he began punching me at random. Again, I must emphasize that the blows caused me very little discomfort but seemed to have an adverse effect on the mobster’s hands. After about thirty seconds, they were bloody and bruised. I asked the Forge Stone if it were possible to lessen the hardness of my skin so that it wouldn’t cause so much damage when I struck people. He (<i>I assume the stone took on a male persona</i>) responded with a curt “<i>affirmative</i>”. Quite frankly, I should come up with a name for him at some point. </p><p>A smug grin plastered upon my face, I held Lorenzo up by the scruff of his collar. “I do apologize, darling. But this shall hurt quite a bit. Still care to be reasonable about all this?”</p><p>Lorenzo spat in my face. “Not a chance, you sparkly bitch! Do your worst.” </p><p>Despite his rude response, I decided not to prolong his suffering. A quick punch to the face did the trick quite nicely, if I do so say myself. He was knocked out cold and I don’t believe I broke anything. Well, perhaps his nose. I’m not sure. According to the Forge Stone, my skin’s hardness was adjusted down to the level of oak. Which was still very hard in comparison to human flesh. </p><p>Ignoring the crumpled heap of injured mobsters, I padded over to an ecstatic Joe and released the binding that held his hands in place. I gasped in surprise when the man hugged me quite abruptly. “Oh, thank you! Whoever you are, naked stranger. If you should ever come around to my shop, you’ll get free food and drink for life. No questions asked. Although—um—just make sure that you’re decent when you do. I’d rather not have the cops visit for anything other than a cup of coffee and some doughnuts…”</p><p>Blushing furiously, I cleared my throat. “You’re quite welcome, dear. I couldn’t just stand by and let those awful men kill you. The whole—ah—nudity bit is due to extenuating circumstances. I assure you that I am usually dressed whilst out in public.” </p><p>Joe laughed. “See ya later, lady. Thanks again for the save. I’m in your debt.” </p><p>With that, Joe ran off to who knows where. I really hope that he didn’t get a good look at my face. The chances were slim, but still entirely plausible that I might run into him someday. It felt good to do something nice, yet… I wasn’t the type of girl who wanted publicity of that nature. Upon dusting myself off, I walked behind the dumpster and took hold of Sunset’s hand. </p><p>“That was fucking nuts, Rarity! I thought they were gonna kill you!” Sunset blubbered while she buried her head into my chest. She embraced me for dear life for quite some time and I wasn’t sure what else to do but hug her back and let her get it out of her system. </p><p>I kissed her forehead and stroked her hair while she had a good cry. “Not to worry, darling. I’m fine. A little bruised perhaps, but no worse for wear. Once you’ve had a chance to calm down and collect yourself, we should focus on getting into Coco’s apartment.”  </p><p>Sunset sniffed loudly. “Yeah. I’m sorry for being so emotional. Everything just caught up with me all at once. So, what’re we supposed to do with the unconscious goons? We can’t just let them sit there. They might try to hurt the people in the apartment complex or worse…” </p><p>“A fair point. I’ll have to improvise something, I suppose.” </p><p>As it turns out, dumpsters are a good place to find bundles of discarded twine. Who knew? In any case, I used the twine to tussle up the ruffians so that they couldn’t go anywhere. Not… that they were in a condition to do so easily. After a minute of careful consideration, we agreed to move them into a patch of bushes in Greenway Park. A hospital would’ve been better, but a pair of nude women didn’t have the luxury of carrying three grown men a few blocks. It had been risky enough just dragging them across the street. </p><p>Once again, Sunset and I lucked out when it came to the back entrance. I’d half expected someone from maintenance to be lurking about, making the night rounds. But that was not the case. There were a few security cameras here and there, I should mention. However, they weren’t much of a concern because most of them were concentrated in the lobby. Sweaty, exhausted, and running on fumes, I carefully knocked on Coco’s front door. At the very least, it was more comfortable standing on plush carpet than pavement while we waited. </p><p>The door opened slowly with a confused and groggy Coco standing behind it. “Rarity? Is that you? What are—<b>OH MY GOODNESS, WHY’RE YOU BOTH NAKED</b>?!!!” </p><p>I let out an awkward chuckle. “I can explain everything, dear. But—ah—might we do so inside?” </p><p>Oh, how wonderful I felt after a hot bubble bath! Coco being Coco, offered to let us wear a spare set of her pajamas and sleep on the futon. We both declined because we were perfectly comfortable lounging about in the nude until it was morning. Well, later in the morning. Neither of us would be sleeping anytime soon. Not after the ordeal we had. Extravagance was elated to see me again and I returned his affection in kind by allowing him to sit on my lap while I stroked his back. It wasn’t long before I heard his soft snores. With the utmost care, I carried him over to his doggie bed, planted a gentle kiss upon his head, and wished him pleasant dreams. </p><p>Sunset let out a heavy sigh while she sipped on a glass full of whiskey and crossed her legs. “So, that’s pretty much the whole story, Coco. I hope you don’t mind us staying with you for the time being. We—uh—kind of got the short end of the stick in this whole mess.”</p><p>Coco frowned. “How awful! I can’t imagine going through something like that.” </p><p>“Indeed. It was quite the ordeal. Did Extravagance behave himself? I hope he wasn’t too much trouble. And if there’s anything either of us can do to repay you, please name it. I must insist.” </p><p>Coco shook her head. “Everything’s fine, Rarity. You don’t owe me anything. I’m just helping out a good friend. I know you’d do the same for me if I was in trouble.”</p><p>I padded over to the teal-haired designer and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. “It’s good to see you too, Coco. How have things between you and Rara been progressing? Good, I hope.”  </p><p>“Oh, yes. Very much so. Tomorrow, we’re going out on our third, official date! Not to sound <i>TOO</i> forward but… I’m looking forward to doing something special with her afterwards. You know, the kind of something you do in bed. Together. With someone special.” </p><p>I chortled. &quot;No need to be coy, darling. Sex is a healthy part of any relationship.” </p><p>Sunset responded with a slurred giggle of her own. “Pffft! Ain’t that the truth, sister? Flash might not have the biggest cock around but he’s got wicked skills, I tell ya! Like, he does this crazy thing with his tongue. It twists around n’ shit, then when he nibbles on my—”</p><p>Coco blushed. “Um… is Sunset drunk?” </p><p>“Yes, I’m afraid so. Don’t be too hard on her. She’s had a rough time.” </p><p>Coco fidgeted in her seat, clearly uncomfortable at the prospect of discussing her (<i>potential</i>) sex life with Rara so openly, even with her closest friend. “I know! Why don’t we watch some TV together? Hmm. Let’s see: it’s almost six o’clock. Some of the early morning news programs should be airing right about now. Would either of you like some coffee?” </p><p>The only sound that came from Sunset was heavy snoring. I made sure to cover her with a blanket while she slept. If nothing else, she seemed to be out cold and oblivious to the outside world. Not exactly the healthiest coping mechanism, but she deserved some rest. In the meantime, I padded out into the kitchen and fixed myself an egg bagel with cream cheese while the coffee pot continued to brew. Despite losing my cookies earlier, I didn’t have much of an appetite. A satisfied smile spread across my lips when I took my first swig of coffee. It tasted like the sweetest ambrosia to my palette. I sat down on the couch, wrapped a blanket around my shoulders, and rubbed my feet together. Like Coco mentioned, the morning news had just begun. </p><p><i>Good Morning, </i><i>Manehatten</i><i>. This is your host, Ace Jackpot with the news. Today’s breaking story comes from a local doughnut shop owner by the name of Doughnut Joe. Several hours ago, he was held at gunpoint by the notorious crime syndicate known as the Magnolias. Death was all but assured, until a mysterious Samaritan showed up just in the nick of time to save him. </i></p><p><i>According to Joe, she handled the assailants with grace befitting of a super-heroine and wore nothing but a beautiful smile. When asked to elaborate on her lack of attire, she did not provide him with a clear answer. However, what is clear to us all is that a life has been saved today. For that, the citizens of this great metropolis are indebted to you, O mysterious unclothed crusader! </i></p><p><i>Coming up next, we’ll explore the restaurant row. For all of you paleo-dieters out there, a new— </i></p><p>I nearly spat out my coffee when I heard the report. A cold sweat broke out all over my body and I felt like curling up into a little ball and dying of embarrassment. Even though the report hadn’t mentioned my name specifically, the details fit the story that Sunset had told Coco to the T. For her part, my fashion forward friend gaped like a carp and was rendered speechless. Not a good sign. It meant that Coco was having a major anxiety episode. I did the only thing I could to calm her down: I snuggled up next to her and began to stroke her hair with my fingers. She didn’t respond right away but at least her breathing seemed to have become less labored. </p><p>“Sunset didn’t mention that you were stabbed and shot at by mobsters! What were you thinking, Rarity?! You could’ve been permanently maimed or killed! The worst part was that you weren’t even wearing clothes at the time. I can’t—that’s just—<b>AAGGHHHHH</b>!!” Coco squeaked. </p><p>“Well, to be fair I’m not wearing any now either…” I offered weakly. </p><p>Coco’s face turned redder than a cherry tomato. It was definitely not out of embarrassment. “I’m not in the mood for your jokes right now. Look, it doesn’t bother me that you’re a naturist. But you can’t do stupid stuff like running around naked, fighting organized crime. I know you have magic powers but you shouldn’t be so reckless. There are people who care about you, Rarity!”  </p><p>I felt ashamed of myself for worrying both her and Sunset so much but I didn’t regret saving Joe’s life. Not one bit. “I know, darling. I know. For that, I’m truly sorry. But I had no other choice. Joe would’ve been murdered had I not intervened. How would his wife and child have felt? I certainly couldn’t have lived with myself had I done nothing. It was well worth the risk.” </p><p>Coco rolled over, nuzzled her cheek against my breast, and proceeded to kiss my chest. I don’t believe there was any prurient intent behind the gesture, rather she simply enjoyed the feeling of my bare skin and the warmth it provided. “Well, I’m glad that you saved his life. Just promise me that you’ll be more careful from now on. Super powers don’t give you the right to be reckless.” </p><p>I’d intended to give Coco a firm answer to her request but she fell asleep before I could do so. With everyone in the apartment now fast asleep, I felt like the odd woman out. For a brief moment, I contemplated staying awake and watching more television. However, a moment later, I found myself letting out a terrible yawn. It seemed that caffeine was no match for a combination of magic and physical exhaustion. So, I gave in instead of resisting. Coco was just so snuggly and warm that I had no trouble falling asleep myself. I’d call Braeburn later.</p>
