		<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ever since I was a child, I've always been fascinated by gemstones and their ability to enhance the beauty in others. After much studying and hard work, I finally earned my degree in Gemology &amp; Metallurgy. Shortly thereafter, I decided to move to Manehatten in order to ply my trade. </p><p>A fair distance from my friends and family to be sure. However, this was so I could fulfill my lifelong dream of opening a jewelry shop of my very own! I may have neglected to mention one crucial detail regarding my life. Regardless of what fashion trend is currently in vogue, I prefer to keep things <i>au naturale</i>. </p><p>Pre-Reader: <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/travolore" rel="nofollow">Travolore</a></p>	</body>
