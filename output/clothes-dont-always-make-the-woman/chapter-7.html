		<h1>A Tropical Paradise Unlike Any Other (II)</h1>


<p><b>Chapter 7</b></p><p><i>Cala Concha</i>, The Beachfront </p><p>We napped together for about an hour or two. Had it been for any longer, we wouldn’t have been able to sleep a wink when night finally arrived. It was already difficult enough adjusting to the eight-hour difference in time zones with jetlag added in. Throwing off our circadian rhythm even further by sleeping through dinner would have done us no good. After freshening up in the bathroom a bit, we locked arms and made our way down to the beach once more. </p><p>There was a fair number of guests attending the seafood bake. Most of them, as I mentioned before, were middle-aged couples on vacation with a few families mixed in. While I was filling my plate with a couple of crab cakes, a little girl with the most adorable set of pigtails tapped my leg and politely asked me to assist her in getting some food. I happily obliged (<i>she wanted chicken fingers and cheesy mac of all things</i>) and waved to her as she scampered off towards a young couple. They smiled and waved back at me. I presumed they must have been her parents. </p><p>Braeburn loaded up on fried oysters, cilantro-lime rice, and lobster tail. The latter being a complete surprise to me. He informed me that while he was staying in Manehattan, he’d developed a taste for the crustacean, but it wasn’t something that he ate often. I preferred crab myself when the occasion presented itself. We ate our meal in comfortable silence, watching the glowing orange sun as it spread across the horizon. Dare I say, it was quite romantic. </p><p>Tropical-themed steel drum music played in the background while we finished up our meal. I thought it was a bit out of place considering we were staying in Mareborne, but it was far more tolerable to listen to than, say, the ubiquitous digeridoo the locals loved so much. Me, personally, I was never a fan of the damned things. If I listened to the instruments long enough, I would get a headache from the low, warbling tones they produced. Culturally insensitive, I know, but true. </p><p>A few paces beyond the buffet tables was an impromptu dance floor that had been set up in the grassy hills overlooking the beach. It was little more than a raised platform with a smooth, wood paneled surface (<i>to avoid getting grass and sand everywhere</i>) and tiki torches placed all around it to create an atmosphere of tropical ambience. I was surprised to see that an actual mariachi band was set up behind it. All of the musicians were performing in the nude. Well, except for their sombreros. I couldn’t help but giggle at such a ridiculous sight. I’d never seen anything like it before. </p><p>Mother &amp; Father were nowhere to been seen. It wasn’t terribly late yet, only a little after seven thirty. However, it’s quite possible that they’d already had their fill of salsa dancing and seafood.  They might’ve gone back to their suite to engage in more… <i>rigorous evening activities</i>. With a slight blush, it finally dawned on me why Father was so agreeable with letting Sweetie have her own room this time around. Let’s just say that my parents had a <u>VERY</u> active and healthy sex life, even though they tended to keep all the details private. Not that I had any issue with their choice, of course. I didn’t like to kiss and tell either.   </p><p>I saw no reason to wait around for my parents, so I took Braeburn out to the dance floor and let the rhythm guide our feet. The music was fairly fast paced but we danced at whatever tempo we felt comfortable with. Brisk but not the sweaty, gyrating that one might find in a typical nightclub. Did I ever mention how wonderful it feels to dance without a shred of clothing on? It’s very similar to skinny dipping in the sense that there’s nothing in the way to restrict your range of motion. The downside you may ask? Well, not that anyone at a naturist resort particularly cares, but certain body parts tend to jiggle around when one dances in their birthday suit. I’d long since gotten used to it, so I didn’t mind. Braeburn didn’t either, for that matter. </p><p>Panting slightly, I pulled Braeburn closer to me and pressed my lips against his. “Mmm. There’s something incredibly romantic about salsa dancing under the moonlight, wouldn’t you say?” </p><p>“Reckon it is. Ah can’t believe I’m sayin’ this but… I’ve been havin’ a great time so far.” </p><p>I slid my hands along his waist and let them rest over Braeburn’s backside. He let out a surprised gasp when I began massaging his delectably firm buns with my fingers.  What can I say? Physical affection amongst naturists tends to be a bit more intimate due to ease of access and differing standards. “And you were so nervous when we first arrived! Why, if I didn’t know any better, Braeburn Apple, I’d say you’re well on your way to becoming a naturist.”   </p><p>“Heh. Well, umm—Ah wouldn’t quite go that far, Rares. But Ah have ta admit that the longer Ah stay nekkid, the less Ah seem ta notice it. Fer the most part, anyway.”</p><p>I smiled. “Excellent! I’m glad to hear that you’ve finally started to enjoy the resort without feeling so self-conscious about your body. I’m very proud of you, Braeburn. Both for stepping so far outside of your normal comfort zone and getting to know my parents better. This whole… experience simply wouldn’t have been the same without you here beside me.”  </p><p>He cupped my cheeks and returned my affection by kissing me deeply and without reservation. To be honest, I’m glad that the lighting was dim and there weren’t many other people on the dance floor. Because it got quite heated between us! His tongue wrestled with mine on several occasions and we both felt hungry for more. There was even a point where he cupped my breast and began caressing it ever so gently. The more rational part of my mind urged me to tell him to stop, but I just couldn’t. It felt far too good. A haze of lust clouded my better judgement.  </p><p>Right as he was rolling my nipple in-between his thumb and index finger, I felt an electric tingle run down my spine all the way to my loins. How long had been since I’d become this aroused? Far too long, in my humble opinion. Since were we so close to one another, I felt something hot brush up against my stomach. It was quite clear to me that Braeburn’s member was becoming stiffer without any signs of stopping. <b>OH NO</b>! Please! Anything but that right now!</p><p>I could already tell that my inner flower was slick with arousal. If one were the optimistic type, this peculiar trait could be considered a blessing from the Belle family gene pool. Back when I was still going through puberty (<i>I was about twelve</i>), I’d had a rather intense erotic dream one night. The following morning, I’d woken up with a large, sticky wet spot underneath me. At first, I thought I’d wet the bed, until Mother explained that I’d simply ejaculated during the dream. I wasn’t even aware that women were capable of doing such a thing at the time, so you can imagine how embarrassed I was to find out that I was one of the rare few who could. </p><p>Beyond that, my arousal had a very distinct aroma to it. Not an unpleasant one, so I’ve been told, but it was sharp and musky, akin to a complex perfume. When one combined this with my propensity to—erm—squirt during orgasms, I’d always been a bit self-conscious when it came to matters of the bedroom. Mainly out of concern as to what my partner would think. I can’t imagine such a thing would make any different to Braeburn, but I wasn’t certain. </p><p>Skin flushed with excitement, I tried to reign myself in. It was difficult to do so because my entire body screamed at me—nay—begged me to spread my legs apart and allow Braeburn to ravish me all night long. I shan’t lie. The idea was appealing to me on many different levels. Especially now that I could feel his hot, erect shaft pressed up against my abdomen.  </p><p>In a strained voice, I held both of his hands. “We really need to stop, darling.”</p><p>Braeburn looked down at his waist and squeaked. “Shit! I’m so sorry, Rares! A-Ah didn’t even realize that mah pecker had gotten so—uh—stiff all of the sudden. Harder ta notice when ya ain’t wearin’ any clothes. Hehe. No resistance n’ such.” </p><p>I poked his chest. “Surely, you must have felt your manhood rubbing up against my tummy…”</p><p>Braeburn blushed deeply and avoided eye contact. “Maybe? Ah got caught up in the moment.” </p><p>“As did I, darling. Perhaps, it’s time that we have a talk about—”</p><p>While Braeburn awkwardly shuffled around, unsure of what to do next, I looked over his shoulder and spotted my little sister approaching us. Drat! Why did Sweetie Belle decide to come to this particular part of the resort at a time like this?! Thinking fast, I placed myself in front of Braeburn so that his erection would be hidden from her view. I wasn’t in much better shape than him, but my own arousal was a bit more difficult to spot unless someone was looking for it. </p><p>“Remain calm, keep your hands on my waist, and <b>DO NOT</b> even think about pressing up against my back. That will only make things worse. Understood?” I hissed. </p><p>Braeburn nodded mutely. I hadn’t meant to sound so bossy but I was frustrated and horny. Not a particularly good combination of emotions to be experiencing at the same time. While I forced myself to smile at my sister and wave, it dawned on me that another person was standing right next to her. Sweetie’s mystery guest was a teenage boy with an average build and chocolate colored skin. His short, orange hair was somewhat messy but the style suited him somehow. </p><p>My mouth nearly gaped open when I realized that the two of them were holding hands. The possibility of Sweetie finding another naturist her age was, admittedly, slim but I didn’t think she’d connect with a boy that quickly. I-I mean, granted… she’d always preferred to show her affection towards others physically, even when it was platonic. Just like mother, in that regard too. But my baby sister having a boyfriend?! Ok, Rarity. Let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. For all you know, they might not be dating but merely holding hands as a gesture of friendship.</p><p>Sweetie looked at me with a confused expression. “Uh… Rarity? How’s come you look like you’ve just run a marathon? And no offense, but you smell kinda funky. Like sweat or something. You should probably take a shower when you get back to your room.”</p><p>I giggle snorted and ended up sounding like a pig. Damn it! I hate it when I do that! Nervous habit. “Oh, well—erm—Braeburn and I just got finished a lively bout of salsa dancing. The funny thing is: it’s far more intense than we anticipated it would be. Isn’t that right, darling?” </p><p>Braeburn shook his head vigorously. “Yeah! A real workout, Ah reckon.” </p><p>“Huh. What do you know about that? Anyway, I just wanted to introduce you guys to my new friend. We met at the entertainment pavilion just like you suggested, Rarity! We chatted for a while, went out for a nice walk along the beach, and even played some video games together. Turns out, we have a lot in common! His name’s Button Mash, by the way.” </p><p>I was truly happy for my sister. They might just be friends for now, but it was clear to me that there was a certain spark between the two of them. Mind you, I was mainly reading their body language. They did look quite comfortable together. As good a sign as any, I suppose. </p><p>I was even more surprised to hear that this Button fellow seemed to be genuinely interested in my little sister as a person, instead of a buxom, young woman to lust over. Even though I’m certain he found Sweetie physically attractive (<i>with a figure like that, who wouldn’t?</i>) as well judging by the way his eyes wandered towards certain parts of her body on occasion. He was still a red-blooded, teenage boy, at the end of the day. I honestly couldn’t fault him for it.</p><p>“Hi, I’m Button. You must be Sweetie’s big sister.”</p><p>I shook his hand. “Yes, I am. It's a pleasure to meet you, darling. You’ll have to excuse me for not giving you a hug but I’m—ah—terribly sweaty at the moment. I hope you understand.” </p><p>“No problem. My Mom says I shouldn’t hug people if they’re uncomfortable with it. That’s why I offered you a handshake instead. You’re just as pretty as Sweetie said you’d be, heh—even though you’re all flushed and sweaty right now. I can tell you guys are related!” </p><p>What an underhanded way to compliment someone. I didn’t sense any malice behind his tone or intent, so perhaps this was simply the way he spoke? “Thank you, dear. I’m glad you think so.” </p><p>“You’re welcome~ Oh! Is that dude standing behind you your boyfriend? Hmm. He looks like one of those cologne models who wear super tight briefs to show off their junk.”</p><p>Oh goodness. This boy has absolutely no mental filter, does he? Ever the country gentleman, Braeburn took his hands off of my hips and went to greet Button. I silently prayed that his erection had subsided by now, but I wasn’t entirely sure how long he could last in that state. It was a question that I would <i>definitely</i> be putting to the test later—EHEM—focus, Rarity. </p><p>While he walked forward, I glanced down towards his waist. Braeburn’s member remained semi-turgid in all it’s thick, veiny glory. Not at full mast like before, but it was still slightly engorged and pointing forward to some degree. I practically had to bite down on my cheeks to keep silent. There was a glistening bead of precum oozing from the tip! The worst part was: I don’t think he even noticed his condition. Button remained oblivious while he shook Braeburn’s hand, but I caught Sweetie starting at his penis quite intently. Her cheeks flushed red like a cherry tomato.  </p><p>As the two men chatted, I scampered over to my baby sister and pulled her aside. “Just so you are aware, things got a bit…. heated between the two of us whilst we were dancing. Yes, what you smelled earlier is <b>EXACTLY</b> what you think it is and the same applies to Braeburn.” </p><p>“Yeah, I figured as much,” Sweetie admitted, “I just didn’t want to embarrass you.”</p><p>I placed my hand on Sweetie’s shoulder. “I truly appreciate your discretion, darling. Believe me, I’ve tried my best to take things slow with Braeburn, but temptation is always right around the corner. Especially, when our state of undress makes certain parts of the human body easily accessible and, by virtue, the acts of affection associated with them more… convenient.” </p><p>Sweetie chuckled. “Tell that to Mom and Dad.”</p><p>“My point exactly. There are worse things, I suppose.”</p><p>Sweetie nodded in agreement. “For sure. I’m glad they love each other so much.”</p><p>“So, am I to assume you’re interested in becoming more than ‘<i>just friends</i>’ with Button?” </p><p>Sweetie blushed and played with her hair. “I dunno yet. Maybe? We’ve only known each other for like, a couple of hours at most. I really do <i>like-like</i> him, though. He’s fun to hang out with and we share a lot of common interests. At first, he was completely dumbfounded that I wanted to hang out with him. It was really cute watching him blush so much!” </p><p>“Fair enough. Just be sure to use protection if you decide to have sex with him.”</p><p>“Rarity,” Sweetie hissed, “We haven’t even kissed yet! How could you think that I’d—”</p><p>“Relax. I’m not trying to imply that you’d immediately spread your legs for Button, dear sister. I’m simply looking out for your wellbeing. These sorts of things can happen to teenagers when the mood strikes. And, may I add, adults too as you’ve seen with Braeburn and I.” </p><p>Sweetie let out an annoyed whine. “You sound just like Dad. I’m not a naïve little girl anymore!” </p><p>I pulled Sweetie into a hug, allowing her to rest her head against my chest. “No, you’re a young woman now. We tell you these things so that you can make an informed decision. Part of being an adult is understanding that your actions can have serious consequences.”</p><p>Sweetie held me tighter and nuzzled her cheek against my collarbone. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to sound ungrateful. It’s just kinda… embarrassing to talk about stuff like that, ya know?” </p><p>I ruffled Sweetie’s hair affectionately and kissed her forehead. “Naturally. If you should ever need someone to talk to about those sorts of things, I’m always here.”</p><p>My little sister hugged me one more time and we walked over to where the boys were chatting amongst themselves. They both looked at us with an expression of concern, but I informed them that we were merely having a private word together as sisters, nothing more. Thankfully, Braeburn appeared to be completely flaccid now that enough time had gone by. I wrapped my arm around his waist, huddled closer to him, and rested my head against his shoulder. </p><p>“Button, might I ask what a young man such as yourself is doing at a naturist resort?” </p><p>Sweetie inched ever closer to Button Mash and then looped her arm around his elbow. It hadn’t escaped my notice that she made a point to sandwich his arm in-between her breasts. Sweetie, of course, grinned like a Cheshire cat when the poor boy became flustered and started blushing up a storm. It seemed that she was determined to send a very clear signal to Button of her intentions. </p><p>“My mom actually works here during the summer. She’s the head pastry chef. Pretty cool, huh? We basically get to live at the resort for free during that time. It’s a pretty sweet deal.” </p><p>“Interesting~ Have you and your mother always been naturists?” </p><p>Button nodded emphatically. “Only for my entire life!” </p><p>I chuckled. “I can certainly see why my little sister took a liking to you, then.” </p><p>“Hehe… y-yeah. You’re cool with us hanging out, right?”</p><p>I held out my hand and gazed at my finely manicured nails. “That depends, Mr. Mash.”</p><p>“On what, exactly?” Button asked hesitantly. </p><p>“What your intentions are. After all, my sister’s maidenhood is at stake here.” </p><p>Sweetie wasn’t looking quite so smug anymore. Her face flushed with what I can only imagine was a mixture of embarrassment and anger. The glare she gave me could have melted steel. “Rarity, you didn’t have to mention that I was still a virgin out loud!” </p><p>Button tried his best to mollify my sister by rubbing her back, but she was furious. “Hey! Don’t sweat it, Sweetie. I don’t have any problem with you being a virgin. I—um—I’m one too…” </p><p>Sweetie let go of his arm and pointed her finger at me accusingly. “See what you did?! Button had to admit something embarrassing too! Rarity, you can’t just say stuff like that in front of—”</p><p>“Why not? It’s my prerogative, as your older sister, to interview any of your potential suitors in lieu of our parents. They aren’t here right now, so I rest my case. Besides, what’s wrong with being a virgin at your age? You’ve just barely turned sixteen, Sweetie Belle. Sexual intercourse isn’t some race to win first place amongst your peers. I hope you understand that.” </p><p>Rather than think rationally about what I was saying, Sweetie stormed off in a huff like a typical teenage girl. To where, I could only assume that she was headed towards her room. This left a very confused and distraught Button Mash who, for the life of me, looked like he was about to cry. I quickly rushed over to his side and offered him a reassuring pat to the back. </p><p>“It’s alright, darling. Sweetie can sometimes get that way. She’s still growing up.” </p><p>Button offered me a meek smile. “Should I… go after her?” </p><p>“No, I’d advise against it. She needs some time to vent.”</p><p>Button shuffled his feet. “Oh. Sorry, I’m not used to dealing with girls.” </p><p>“Pardon my curiosity, but is Sweetie the first girl to show any interest in you?” </p><p>Button rubbed his neck. “Yeah. I didn’t think someone like her would ever want to talk to me. Sweetie’s the kind of girl who would usually be WAAAAAY out of my league.” </p><p>Braeburn offered an encouraging pat as well. “Ya never know until ya try. Ah felt the same way about Rarity and look at us now. Granted, Ah ain’t no expert when it comes ta matters of romance but Ah can tell Sweetie’s really taken a shinin’ to ya.” </p><p>“You mean… she <i>like-likes</i> me?!”  </p><p>I couldn’t help but laugh at how sweet and innocent Button was. “As her older sister, I can confirm, without a shadow of a doubt, that she does. Button, I want you to understand that I wasn’t trying to put you on the spot earlier. I was simply trying to gauge your character.” </p><p>“I’d never force her to have sex with me! Only creeps do that sort of thing.” </p><p>I breathed a sigh of relief. He truly was a kind-hearted boy. “Indeed. But that does beg the question: are you attracted to my little sister? In the physical sense, I mean. You don’t have to be shy. Just be honest. I promise that your answer won’t upset me in any way.” </p><p>Button blushed furiously. “Mhmm. Sweetie has a great body. And her boobs are super soft!” </p><p>“Well, I certainly can’t argue with you on either of those points.” </p><p>Button bit his lip. “So—um—you’re not mad at me for looking at your sister?” </p><p>“Of course not. I would expect as much from a teenage boy. However, I do take issue with anyone who mistreats her in any way. Physically, verbally, or emotionally. If I find out that you’ve <u>EVER</u> done anything to harm her, <b>I WILL END YOU</b>. Have I made myself clear?” </p><p>Button chuckled nervously. “Crystal, ma’am.”</p><p>I gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. “Excellent~ That being said, I think you’re an upstanding young man with a keen sense of morality. And you’re a naturist too. Those factors combined makes you an excellent match for my little sister. She’s been looking for someone like you for quite some time now. Should you be interested in dating her, you have my blessing.” </p><p>“Thank you, Miss Rarity! I’m probably gonna go back to my room now, since it’s getting late. Have fun with Mr. Braeburn and I guess… I’ll see you guys later. Bye!” </p><p>I yawned while we watched Button scamper off towards the main building. “My goodness! I can’t believe how tired I am. It’s been quite a long day.”</p><p>“Sure has.” </p><p>We began walking along the beach at a sedate pace, arm in arm. The crescent moon rose high above us and the stars twinkled around it like a tapestry of nature’s design. A cool breeze tickled our bare skin, as the surf washed over our feet. It was surreal. During the daytime, the ocean was a place so full of sound and vigor… yet at night it was quiet as the grave. Not that I minded the tranquility, of course. I just happened to notice how much of a stark contrast there was. </p><p>“Do you mind if we head back to the room and call it a night?” I asked softly. </p><p>“Ain’t no harm in it, Ah reckon.” </p><p>When we finally took a shower and got ready for bed, I couldn’t help but get the sense that Braeburn was disappointed somehow. I snuggled up against his back and made myself comfortable, basking in his scent. He squeezed my hand one last time, then promptly fell asleep. As I listened to him breathe, I sighed to myself. Tomorrow, I would make it up to him. We were going to do something special together and no one was going to interrupt us! For now, though, I needed my beauty rest. I wrapped my arms around his stomach and fell asleep too. </p><hr/><p>The following morning was a fairly standard affair. We woke up, showered, had a light breakfast of fruit and oatmeal, then drank a cup of coffee together while looking out at the ocean. Braeburn didn’t appear to be in a bad mood, per say, but he seemed distant… dare I say, melancholic. I tried to lighten the mood by rubbing my foot along his leg underneath the table. His eyes widened slightly in surprise, but he didn’t react otherwise. I looked down at my coffee and sighed. Perhaps, I’d underestimated how great his desire was to consummate our relationship.</p><p>“What’s the matter, darling? Are you not feeling well this morning?” </p><p>Braeburn blinked owlishly. “Huh? Oh—um—nah, I’m just a little tired. Nothin’ ta worry about.” </p><p>“Are you sure? If there’s anything bothering you, I’d be more than happy to talk about it.” </p><p>“I’m good. What’ve ya got planned fer today, Rares?” Braeburn asked. </p><p>I clapped my hands together. “Well, I was thinking that we could go for an early morning walk along the beach. Since we haven’t gone swimming yet, I think that could be bundled into the itinerary as well. What do you think? Does that sound like a good idea to you, darling?” </p><p>“Ah suppose so. Ain’t like I’ve got anythin’ better ta do.” </p><p>I frowned inwardly at his less than enthusiastic response. “Splendid! We’ll just need to pack a few things: like towels, a couple of water bottles, and sunglasses. I took the liberty of bringing along some stylish fanny packs for us to put our belongings in too. They’re matching colors~” </p><p>Braeburn rubbed the back of his neck. “Really? Ah don’t think I’ve ever worn one of those things before. How’s come we can’t just wear backpacks?” </p><p>“Because the straps will dig into our skin, dear. One must be mindful of chafing.” </p><p>Braeburn cocked his eyebrow. “And these fanny packs won’t? They’ve got a strap too.” </p><p>“If you must know, they are specially designed for naturists by naturists. And I got them buy one get one free from the website that sells them, so sue me! And don’t even think about complaining. You’re just going to have to swallow your manly pride and wear one.”</p><p>With a resigned sigh, Braeburn agreed. Once we finished our coffee, we headed back to the room, applied sunscreen as needed, and donned our equipment. My fanny pack was royal purple (<i>it matched my hair, of course</i>) and Braeburn’s was a handsome shade of cherry red. I thought it complimented his complexion quite well, but he still didn’t seem too thrilled about wearing it.  </p><p>We took our time walking along the white sand beaches of <i>Cala Concha</i>. It was an absolutely beautiful day outside. Big, fluffy clouds floated lazily in the sky while a cool ocean breeze accompanied the songs of seabirds. I took in a deep breath and appreciated the salty air. This place truly was a tropical paradise. I just wish that Braeburn would stop being such a Debbie downer and try to enjoy himself as well. Maybe a refreshing dip would do him some good. </p><p>Even if it didn’t, what I had planned afterwards would certainly make him feel better. At least… that was my hope. I tried not to overthink my strategy, lest I become a neurotic mess like Twilight Sparkle. Our world’s version of her, not the pony princess. I mean, for all I know she could have similar tendencies but I never got the chance to spend much time with her. She very rarely had time to visit us (<i>probably because of her royal duties</i>) and I wasn’t about to step through some magic mirror portal to another universe. Geomancy was more than enough magic for a girl like me, thank you very much! </p><p>Earlier, I’d studied a map of the surrounding area to try and find the most secluded spot possible for our day together. It wasn’t nearly as difficult as you might think, considering that <i>Cala Concha</i> was designed to be a semi-private resort in the first place. So far, we hadn’t really run into any other guests yet. I suppose that also had to do with the time of day it was.  </p><p>I found the perfect little cove surrounded by rock on one side and a smattering of tropical vegetation on the other. That’s where we decided to set up camp, as it were. We took off our fanny packs, placed them by a palm tree, and got out our water bottles to take a drink. I immediately began stretching (<i>I made sure to bend over towards Braeburn</i>) and encouraged my beau to do the same. He did so absentmindedly, more due to the fact that he was distracted by my body, rather than his melancholy. That was a good sign. I definitely had his attention~</p><p>“Catch me if you can, darling!” I whispered into his ear. </p><p>You should have seen it. A grown woman running full throttle towards the ocean with her boyfriend chasing her close behind. It was utterly ridiculous but so much fun! I laughed and played in the surf like a child would, without a care in the world. Ah~ The water felt absolutely wonderful. It was the perfect temperature and crystal clear too. I could see all the way to the bottom. As I dove underwater, a few exotic fish swam around me like I was part of their school. </p><p>I took one more look at the beautiful coral reef and headed back up to the surface. For a moment, I was worried because I couldn’t see Braeburn anywhere. It was as if he’d just disappeared into thin air. Mere moments later, I let out a lady-like scream of terror when he suddenly surfaced in front of me with a shit-eating grin plastered on his face. He proceeded to boop my nose.</p><p>“Now, I’ve got ya.” </p><p>My cheeks flushed red. “Braeburn! You nearly scared me out of my wits!” </p><p>“Who’s bein’ the sourpuss this time, huh?” </p><p>With a lovely smile like that, how could I possibly stay mad at him? “No harm done; I suppose.” </p><p>Braeburn swam over to the shallows and I followed shortly thereafter. The water was low enough that it only went up to our waists. He waded over to me, placed his hands on either side of my head, and pulled me into a passionate kiss. Since there was no one else around, we took our time exploring each other’s mouths, wrestling for dominance with our tongues. Now, I had my answer. He really did want to pick up where we left off the night prior. </p><p>I broke free from his lips and smiled. “Trying to set the mood, are you?” </p><p>“Eeyep. Sorry if Ah was actin’ strange earlier. I’ve been feelin’ a bit frustrated.” </p><p>We embraced each other and I kissed his neck. “In what regard?” </p><p>“Ah dunno. It’s hard ta explain. Kinda like we’re always bein’ interrupted.” </p><p>I let go of him and began walking towards our spot. “Come along, darling.” </p><p>The poor dear looked utterly baffled. I’d already begun spreading the oversized towel on top of the grass by the time he joined me. Without a word, I laid down and beckoned him to come join me. I’m not sure how long we lounged around like that, letting the sun dry our skin. Just as Braeburn closed his eyes to take a quick cat nap, I took the opportunity to shift my position and nestle myself in-between his legs. My heart thundered in my chest. There was no going back after what I was about to do. Calm yourself, Rarity. You’re just a little bit out of practice is all.  </p><p>I carefully wrapped my fingers around his shaft and began massaging it. That alone might have done the trick but I wanted to take it a step further. I leaned forward and started peppering his entire length with little butterfly kisses. This, of course, had the intended effect of rousing him from his cat nap and attracting Braeburn’s undivided attention. In both senses of the word. </p><p>Oh, goodness! The smell of his manhood was incredibly musky. It was like inhaling the pure, concentrated essence of Braeburn Apple. I immediately felt my loins begin to stir with excitement. At the risk of sounding like a trollop, I was horny and wanted more. So, I did the only sensible thing I could think of and began performing fellatio. By now, Braeburn was fully erect and I was having some difficulty accommodating his girth in its entirety. In that regard, I took my time pleasuring him orally while I gently fondled his balls with my other hand.  </p><p>Braeburn moaned softly when I swirled my tongue along the tip of his head. “Heavens above, Rares! Ah ain’t gonna last much longer if ya keep that up. Unnnhh—feels so good…” </p><p>As men are often wont to do, he placed his hands on either side of my head and began stroking my hair. It didn’t feel unpleasant by any means, I just never figured out why they chose to do it. Perhaps, it was simply an earnest desire to reciprocate the pleasure they were feeling, despite being in a compromising position. Who knows? I never claimed to be a clinical psychologist. </p><p>I could tell Braeburn was getting close to his limit. There were subtle signs of it if one cared to read them. Like more frequent moaning, moving his hips forward ever so slightly, and his breathing becoming more labored. Feeling emboldened by his positive response to my technique, I decided to test something I’d read in a magazine once. I pressed my fingers against the area right where the root of his ball sac ended. Supposedly, this was the male equivalent to a g-spot. </p><p>The effect was immediate. Braeburn cried out and I felt him ejaculate directly into my mouth. Embarrassed as I am to admit it, I nearly gagged and started coughing. It was very difficult to swallow but I did so anyway. You see, my troubles were caused by the consistency of his semen. It was sticky and viscous, similar to honey but vastly different in so many ways. There wasn’t much flavor to it initially but his semen did have a distinct, briny, almost fishy aftertaste.   </p><p>I removed his member from my mouth with a slick pop, and went about squeezing his shaft for any residual cum that might have been left behind. His eyes widened in amazement when a little glob came out of the tip and I licked it clean. I laid down next to Braeburn as he wrapped his arm around me and we cuddled for a little while. After a bout of comfortable silence, he looked over at me with the most peculiar expression. It was as if he was having difficulty forming words. </p><p>“That was just… amazin’. Thank ya, Rares. Ah really needed that.” </p><p>I kissed his chest. “You’re quite welcome, darling. I got the sense that you desperately needed some kind of release from all the sexual tension that’s been building up between us. I’m sorry that it took me so long to pleasure you, but I wanted to make sure the time was right.” </p><p>“Rares, there’s somethin’ Ah gotta tell ya. It’s of a personal nature.” </p><p>I rubbed my hand along his abs encouragingly. “Go on. I promise that I shan’t laugh.” </p><p>“Well—erm—the thing is… I’m still a virgin. Never been intimate with a woman before. Especially one as beautiful as ya. That’s why I’m at a loss as ta what I’m supposed ta do next. Ya seem so experienced that I’m afraid I’ll just end up disappointin’ ya if Ah try anythin’.” </p><p>I cupped his cheek and looked directly into those dazzling, emerald pools. “To be quite honest, I’m not as experienced as you might think. In fact, it’s been ages since I last had sex with anyone. My point is: I don’t care that you’re a virgin, Braeburn. We can just take things slow and experiment a little. That’s what love is all about. Consider this a learning experience, ok?” </p><p>Braeburn’s cheeks lit up in the most adorable blush. “Alright. Land’s sakes! I’m more nervous than a jackrabbit in a fox’s den. What do ya want me ta do first, if ya don’t mind me askin’.” </p><p>I rolled over onto my back and used my fingers to spread my lips apart, so that he could get a good look at my flower. “I’m sure you know what this is. Try kissing it, licking it, or whatever strikes your fancy. I promise that I’m not picky. Take as much time as you need, darling.” </p><p>“Yer pussy’s such a pretty shade of pink, Rares. Kinda reminds me of smoked salmon,” Braeburn remarked as he carefully ran his finger along my folds, “Is it supposed ta be all shiny?”</p><p>It was my turn to blush. “Yes, dear. That means I’m aroused.” </p><p>He took in a deep breath and smiled. “Ya smell good too. Ah like it. Wonder how ya taste?” </p><p>Without any warning whatsoever, Braeburn plunged face first into my kitty. I could tell that he was an amateur but what he lacked in skill, he more than made up for in enthusiasm. His tongue probed my depths like a velvety snake, wriggling and writhing while he teased my nubbin with his thumb. It was a sensation I hadn’t felt in such a long time and it felt so VERY right. I laid back, gripped the towel, and moaned unabashedly as an orgasm wracked my entire body. Thankfully, I wasn’t one of those poor, unfortunate souls who required a vast amount of simulation and time to achieve them. A blessing, in my humble opinion.  </p><p>When Braeburn pulled away, his face glistened and he was absolutely covered in my nectar. Rather than be off put by it, he seemed to enjoy that fact that he’d made me ejaculate. “Damn. Do all gals—uh—squirt so much when they get an orgasm or…” </p><p>“No, I’m afraid that’s something specific to me. I’m sorry if it bothers you, but I can’t control—”</p><p>Braeburn kissed my lips (<i>the lower ones</i>) and chuckled. “Nah, Ah don’t mind. Ya taste sweet. Heh. Almost like a marshmallow. Appropriate, considerin’ the color of yer skin.” </p><p>I let out an embarrassed squeak and blushed profusely. “Don’t you dare say that in public!” </p><p>Braeburn grinned and began peppering my tummy with kisses and raspberries. It made me break down into a fit of snorting giggles, which only served to embarrass me further. He, of course, enjoyed every second of it, laughing in amusement as I tried to compose myself. Panting heavily, I watched as he positioned himself above me and brushed an errant strand of my hair away from my face. The unrestrained passion I saw in his eyes almost made me want to cry. </p><p>“Rarity, Ah wanna make love to ya. Would ya be ok with that?” </p><p>I reached up and caressed his cheeks, trying my best to keep my emotions in check. “Yes, I would be honored to be your first, Braeburn.”</p><p>We kissed one more time and then Braeburn scooted back a bit so that he could have easy access in-between my legs. I thought that his penis would have become flaccid by this point, but it was just as stiff as it had been before I made him cum. I held my breath while he gripped the base of his shaft and rubbed it all over my lips, making his entire length slick with my arousal. I didn’t want Braeburn to accidentally penetrate the wrong hole (<i>unlikely but still possible</i>), so I spread my lips apart once more in order to show him exactly where he needed to insert his manhood. </p><p>“Please make sure that you enter me gradually. Otherwise, it can be quite painful.” </p><p>Braeburn nodded and began pushing forward. I gasped as his thick, veiny cock inched deeper and deeper inside of me. I can personally attest that he is the most well-endowed man to have ever penetrated me. The sensation of being filled so thoroughly, even gradually, was… indescribable. It was as though my poor kitty was being stretched to absolute the limit! </p><p>When he finally bottomed out and we were joined as one, I grunted. “Oh goodness! You’re just so thick, Braeburn. I got a sense of your girth beforehand but… this is something else.”</p><p>Braeburn shot me a look of concern. “Does it hurt? Ah can pull out if ya want.” </p><p>“No! Really, I’ll be alright. I just… need a moment to adjust.” </p><p>Braeburn nodded. “Ok. But ya gotta let me know if it starts ta hurt.”</p><p>After an embarrassingly long adjustment period (<i>it was only about thirty seconds but it felt like an eternity to me</i>), I let him know that I was ready for him to start moving. He lifted my legs into the air and took hold of my thighs, a position that was meant to make us more comfortable. His thrusts were slow and methodical at first because… well, he had no experience doing it before. As time wore on, however, Braeburn found a good rhythm that we both enjoyed. </p><p>I gripped the towel and desperately tried to catch my breath. Braeburn was moving his hips at a much faster pace than before and I could tell that my own body was mere moments away from another mind-blowing orgasm.  “Nnnngh! Yes! Keep going! I’m about to cum!” </p><p>Braeburn plunged his manhood into me until his balls brushed up against my pucker. My walls responded by constricting around him like a velvety vice while I moaned in ecstasy. Soon after, I arched my back as the electric pleasure of an orgasm radiated throughout my body. After hearing a loud grunt, I felt something hot fill my belly to the point of overflowing. We both collapsed into a sweaty pile of flesh and limbs atop the towel afterwards. Exhausted but utterly satisfied. </p><p>I sighed contentedly and rested my head upon Braeburn’s chest. “Mmmm. You performed admirably for a virgin, darling. I haven’t enjoyed sex like that in ages! Thank you again for being gentle. It meant the world to me that you were so considerate of my needs. Just remember: practice makes perfect. And you’d better believe that we’re going to be practicing quite often~” </p><p>“Ah enjoyed makin’ love to ya as well, Rares. Mah pecker ain’t too big around fer ya, is it?” </p><p>I started playing with his pubic hair. “In all honesty, it was at first. You must understand that I’ve never made love to anyone so… handsomely endowed before. Not to worry though! Given enough time and practice, I’ll get used to your girth eventually. I promise you that.” </p><p>“Good. Ah got the impression ya were tryin’ real hard not ta show how much of a struggle it was. Also, yer real tight and slippery down there, if ya catch mah meanin’. It ain’t a bad thing, of course. It’s just that… a couple of times, Ah though ya were gonna milk me dry. Heh.” </p><p>My cheeks turned a rosy shade of pink. “Yes, well I do keep in shape. Such is to be expected.” </p><p>Braeburn reached over and began massaging my breast with the gentlest of motions. He would occasionally tease my nipple with his fingertips every so often too. I don’t think he was trying to arouse me; it was just an affectionate gesture to make me feel good. I enjoyed it, so I didn’t ask him to stop. “Ah know. Even when we were teenagers, Ah could always tell that ya took good care of yer body. It’s even more obvious now that we ain’t wearin’ any clothes.”</p><p>“Indeed. The same could be said for you too, darling. I admit that I might have looked forward to those hot summer days when you had your shirt off. The view was quite breathtaking.” </p><p>Braeburn laughed. “Funny ya should mention that. Granny always warned me not ta do that whenever guests were around. Particularly, any of Applejack’s gal pals from CHS. Ah listened ta her fer the most part, except when ya came over. Then, I’d do it just ta see if ya would notice.” </p><p>I leaned over and nibbled on his ear. “You sly dog! Now, at least you know that it worked~” </p><p>“Only wish I’d have worked up the courage ta ask ya out years ago.”</p><p>I embraced him tightly. “Let’s not waste our time on hypotheticals, dear. We’re together now, and we love each other. That’s all that matters in the end. Wouldn’t you agree?”</p><p>“Yeah. Ah reckon you’re right about that.”</p><p>As much as I didn’t want to end our post-coital cuddling session, I knew that we couldn’t stay on the beach for the remainder of the day. Too many questions would be asked by my family and I would eventually get terrible sunburn all over my body. Unfortunately, sunscreen only offers so much protection for people with a fair complexion such as myself. </p><p>That’s why I would always try to lay under a parasol and limit the amount of time I spend swimming outdoors. Well, at least when it was under direct sunlight. Forested areas posed no such risk, and why I preferred them. Indoor pools, like the one Dalia had, were even better. </p><p>I got up off of the towel and stretched. “I think we should prepare to head back to the main building soon. I don’t know about you, darling but a good shag always makes me hungry. I’d like to grab a bite for lunch, if possible.” </p><p>Braeburn walked up behind me, wrapped his arms around my waist, and kissed my neck. “Can’t argue with ya there. Mah stomach’s been growlin’ somethin’ fierce since we finished up. Do ya think the chefs ‘round here can make decent fried chicken? Been cravin’ it fer a while now…”  </p><p>“It’s possible, I suppose. We won’t know until we ask. In the meantime, I think it would be prudent for us to go for a quick swim in the ocean. If only to freshen up. We can’t very well walk around the resort smelling like we just had a rigorous bout of sweat-inducing sex.” </p><p>Braeburn sniffed himself and blushed. “Hehe. Ya got a point there, Rares.” </p><p>I glanced over at the soiled beach towel we had just made love upon and crinkled my nose. “My apologies, Braeburn. In my haste, I’d forgotten to pack any extra towels to dry off with. We’ll just have to let the sun and the wind dry us off the natural way. It shouldn’t be an issue.” </p><p>Except for my hair. Saltwater, sand, and wind tended to make it extremely frizzy. Nothing a good bottle of conditioner couldn’t fix but it was still a hassle nonetheless. With a resigned sigh, I ran towards the surf and dove right in, washing myself as best I could. Braeburn did the same and before I knew it, we were already making our way towards the main campus. We enjoyed a lovely lunch together in the cafeteria (<i>which I assure you had resort quality meals</i>), then contemplated what we would do for the remainder of the day.</p>
